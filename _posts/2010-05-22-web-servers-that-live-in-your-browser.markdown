  content: It&#39;s news to me. Been looking around for stuff like this for a few  <br>weeks.
    It hasn&#39;t caught on so there must be issues

  content: Yeah as Brian said, Opera released this a while back. Opera has had some
    pretty cool ideas but not enough to make people switch. I think it&#39;s a good
    idea in concept but the Unity projects really need to span all browsers to be
    successful.

<p>This is a pretty amazing find if it's true. <a HREF="http://unite.opera.com//">OperaUnite</a> is a browser based server that will allow hosting files, web sites, and most importantly to me, fully distributed social networks. Imagine a one click install personal social server install? I'll be reading more on this concept in the coming days, as I've been wrestling with this from a RubyJS/GWT perspective but pretty clueless on how to connect a database and functional backend framework. A more focused browser may be the missing component of my quest. </p>
