<p>It's another one of those Sunday mornings where time is tight but I feel like I have an eternity to lounge around. The music that immediately came to mind was the background music <a href="http://pdxbrain.com/">Tyler Gillies</a> (<a href="https://github.com/tjgillies">git home</a>) used for one of his first screen casts at Victus Media showing some late night hack productivity. Looks like Tyler is heading to Europe next week for a mobile web development conference, safe journey! </p>
<p>Sit back, relax and enjoy the melody as much as I do.</p>
