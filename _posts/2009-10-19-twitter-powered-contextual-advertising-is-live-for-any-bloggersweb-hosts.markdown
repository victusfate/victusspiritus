  content: It&#39;s an interesting angle to attempt...I *think* it&#39;s going to
    be hard to get people to &#39;log into twitter&#39; just so they can be targeted
    for ads...you might need to come up with some other benefit/reason to get them
    to log in (and make the targeting of ads a nice side benefit to that action)...the
    key here is also going to be intelligent semantic processing of their feeds/data
    in real-time (that&#39;s a great space with a ton of action right now, but also
    a VERY hard nut to crack, it will be interesting to see how leveraging Zemanta
    works for you on this)...<br><br>Overall I think you&#39;ve got a good start and
    gives people something to see/play with for sure...will be watching to see where
    you take it from here :-)

  content: "[...] The truth strength of social media came into play within the wave
    space of Google Wave. Mark and Tyler bumped into each other and while editing
    the same wave. Mark gave Tyler his standard shpiel about the value of connecting
    what we talk about online, and a personalized web experience. Tyler took the concept
    and produced a deployable alpha version of the code. He fixed Mark&#8217;s &#8220;problematic&#8221;
    php, then made the great conceptual leap to use Amazon web services. Read more
    about it here. [...]"

<p>*update please visit <a href="http://www.victusmedia.com">Victus Media</a> for information, the ad tool is no longer supported. The current web app is live here <a href="http://imagebrowser.heroku.com/site">imagebrowser.heroku.com</a>*</p>
<p>I bumped into a great php coder yesterday on Google wave, Tyler Gillies. We're now looking forward to starting a business with Tyler's prototype. He was able to quickly evolve my example, by connecting user's social media with relevant ads from Amazon. This is the early form of the code available for insert into any web page or blog. Big thanks to Bostjan (and Andraz) from <a class="zem_slink" title="Zemanta" rel="homepage" href="http://www.zemanta.com">Zemanta</a> for their early support and great work on their semantic tool. They'll be getting a portion of the revenue generated based on access to their API, we still need to finalize a fee that fits well with their teams business plan. Special thanks to cofounder <a href="http://vukicevic.blogspot.com/">Vladimir Vukicevic</a>, I'm sure he'll be happy to see this concept advance past the abstract phase, to the testing phase.</p>
<p>Insert the following snippet into a text widget on the side of your wordpress blog, or in any site that allows iframes (mycoolidnumber is your Amazon affiliate ID):</p>
<p>Updated Ruby on Rails version: (*update please visitÂ <a href="http://victusmedia.com">Victus Media</a> for updates*)</p>
<p>&lt;iframe width="100%" height="600" src="http://imagebrowser.heroku.com?type=caro&amp;associate=mycoolidnumber" frameborder=0&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p>
<p>or if you don't have an Amazon affiliate account:</p>
<p>&lt;iframe width="100%" height="600" src="http://imm.victusmedia.com?type=caro" frameborder=0&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p>
<p>The code is live on this site and Tyler's, feel free to test it out. (see Contextual Advertising 0.1 in my sidebar to the right).</p>
<p>By default the split is 10% to our business, and 90% to host (if no amazon affiliate link is entered 100% will go to our business). Right now that's the personal Amazon IDs of mine and Tyler's.</p>
<p>This is done by randomizing the ID used in the link, and should be publicly trackable (we're both at 5% at this point).</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">All readers are encouraged and welcome to try this out, it should be a blast. If the Zemanta API calls top out, hold off for a bit and I'll work with them on getting us a temporary expansion of the calls to verify we actually have a working business model.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">1) Short term goals include incorporation, and improvements on the efficacy of the algorithm (pattern matching techniques, subgroups, clustering).</span></p>
<p>2) Longer term plans include powerful intelligent search assistant tools, to enable richer and more fluid user browsing experiences as well as personally relevant ads (dumb ads are history).</p>
<p>We setup a business web site at <a href="http://victusmedia.com">victusmedia.com</a></p>
