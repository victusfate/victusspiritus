<p>We have a dilemna. We don't know exactly how to create monetary value for something we care about, great content. We want to support great content but not have to pay for the right to read, watch, or listen to it.</p>
<p>As users we find great value in genuine referalls given by trusted sources. These sources can be friends from our social graph, or influential and respected authorities that have shown continued dedication to sharing their informed views about topics we care about.</p>
<p>Advertising will gain our attention when it provides value, and when it is pertinent to us. It will have to be both timely and unbiased.</p>
<h2>Remove Advertising Company Bias</h2>
<p>How can paid advertising come from genuine sources? When the users are paying for it. That's right, sometimes we'll pay for the right to hear the truth, uncluttered by spin doctoring. For subscriptions that are near free (less than 25cents per user per month) we'll look to our friends and associates to give genuine feedback and ratings to all companies and products. On top of this businesses won't even enter our peripheral view unless they pay for the right or are news worthy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the best and transparent businesses, that have our trust will survive the scrutiny of millions of customers relentlessly reviewing their best offerings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of paying for a newspaper full of editorials and ads, we'll pay for an internet subscription that's full of genuine product reviews matched to our needs and interests. How much is the truth worth to us?</p>
