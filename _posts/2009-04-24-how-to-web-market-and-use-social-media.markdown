  If you don't shout out that you have something worth reading, it's unlikely that
  anyone else will discover it anytime soon.  If you can join a small community of
  like minded individuals it makes spreading your ideas even faster.  Not only will
  you have the constructive criticism and shared views of other interested marketers,
  but you'll have people willing to review your material on crowd sourced social web
  sites."

feel a need to write, without readers your words will have little impact.  Since it's my deepest hope to inspire people, to instigate critical thinking and focus I for one am working to find readers.</li>

- In case you just landed on Earth, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a> is a tool that feels like part chat room, part news feeder, part network marketer.  Seriously try it out with a browser addon, and check the public channel to find interesting tweets.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.squidoo.com/TwitterTutorial">Take this Short Twitter Tutorial</a><br />
- This twitter tutorial page is designed for entry level twitter users, or folks who have never used twitter before. It will cover the basics of signing up, grabbing an easy to use interface, and much of the lingo and basic functionality of twitter.</li>

There's a strong correlation with our deep biologically programmed need for belonging and social networking on the internet.  We are much more willing to accept advice from a trusted friend then from a search algorithm about where to find pertinent information.</li>

Mr. Robert Scoble, known to many in the online community as the Scobleizer, is one of the trailblazers in a new field I like to call <em>Virtual Omniscience</em>. He's bascially monitoring the pulse of the world via the internet, or at least a sizeable slice of human experience.  By applying twitter and friend feed with his personal dynamic quality filters he keeps pace with what's happening and is connecting with an interested audience of thousands of individuals.</li>

riches?</a> - The utility of twitter as a profit engine has been a growing concern for Evan Williams.  Other social services are quickly adapting to the popularity of microblogging within their own social media structures (Facebook, FriendFeed).  While I have posted on the potential of twitter before, the real value is in the datamining application of microblogging.</li>
