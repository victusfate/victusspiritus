    I'm enjoying the community that problogger has founded with his
    generosity.  I'm surprised by how much I've learned in such a short
    period of time, and at meeting incredible folks like yourself!  Will
    definitely keep up with your blogging.

    Nice one Mark,
    I truly love what I do, but you're right; the point of living is to enjoy life. Why do what you do if you do not enjoy what you do.
    The saying, "do you live to work, or work to live", might also have a part in that thought process.
    BTW Thanks for the comment on my Blog, I see that you are enjoying the 31 day challenge as much as I am. keep it up

<p>I'm two chapters in and loving it so far.  Thanks to Jonathan for taking the time and effort to organize his thoughts and develop a cogent and effective strategy to <a href="http://www.illuminatedmind.net/reclaim-your-dreams/">Reclaim our Dreams</a>.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-21"></a></p>
<p>Here are selected high points during my reading experience:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Jonathan engages the readers with<br />
a series of questions to get them thinking about their own paths from the very<br />
beginning.  It quickly becomes evident this is not a guided tour but simply a tool kit to aid oneself in their own quest for rediscovering their true calling.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">He muses "Why do you live?" … Jonathan reached<br />
an answer for himself: "The point of living is to enjoy life", and finds it to be a commonality among those he has personally observed.  Each of our lives has central themes which we can learn from and find nourishment.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Then he proceeds to ask common concerns we share:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">"We have questions such as these:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">What happens if doing what I love<br />
isn't practical?</li>
<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">What happens if I can't make any<br />
money with my passion?</li>
<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">What happens if I'm not good at<br />
following my heart?</li>
<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I don't seem to have time for the<br />
things I love. How do I make time?"</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">By bringing light to these barriers to self development he forces us to to see that they are merely perceived obstacles and excuses not to follow our inner nature.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In chapter 1, "unbrainwashing or creating room<br />
for your dreams to grow" I was reminiscent of the Jedi training words of<br />
Yoda, “you must unlearn what you have learned”.  Jonathan warns that many of us become a prisoner of our own ingrained thought processes.  “Instead of owning your thoughts,<br />
your thoughts own you. You start to identify with your thoughts, and<br />
pretty soon the conflict in your mind is too much. It's always<br />
judging, always brooding about something.”  This causes us harm because we are comparing our current state of being with one that is unachievable or impossible.  “Constantly comparing yourself<br />
against an image of perfection causes you to search for something<br />
you'll never have and strive to become someone you'll never be. It<br />
doesn't exist”.  I believe what he is describing is a differentiation from our creativity and analytical minds, which is based on holding possible choices in opposition (juxtaposition), and our true selves.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">For chapter 2 we are coached to "Stop Caring".  I was particularly impressed with the warning signs of "toxic caring":</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">“Some Symptoms of toxic caring<br />
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We value productivity and<br />
accomplishments more than what makes us come alive</li>
<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We give more merit to the bullet<br />
points on our resumes than the contents of our character</li>
<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We care more about the size of our<br />
bank accounts than the fulfillment of our passions</li>
<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Efficiency and getting things done<br />
becomes more important than how much we enjoy what we're doing”</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again I humbly thank Jonathan Mead for taking the time and energy to orchestrate his powerful message and giving each of us a chance to <a href="http://www.illuminatedmind.net/reclaim-your-dreams/">"Reclaim Your Dreams"</a>.</p>
