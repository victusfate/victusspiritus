  content: Ive been in the same quandry several times over the years - looking for
    the perfect machine with which I will be spending the majority of my time.  Each
    of the last three times I've settled on a Mac (iBook, then Powerbook, now MacBook)
    each time small (12", 12", 13.3").  Virtualbox runs killer fast on it, but there
    have been a lot of times that I have wished it was running Ubuntu instead.

    good to hear they've served you well.

  content: Re-reading the above I guess I didn't actually give you much qualitative
    info.  I've been very happy with the quality of all of my Macs.  While its considered
    "slick" by a lot of people, I'm personally not such a big fan of OS X - I'd much
    rather use Linux (and apt-get kicks ass by the way IMO) but when you're looking
    at hardware, theres really nothing on par with the Mac.  The only other thing
    I'd add is that you can always have mobility without sacrificing big screen!  I
    have a big screen on my desk and when I'm there I just plug my laptop into it!

  content: |-
    Groovy, thanks for additional info.

    I'm leaning towards the Macbook Air top end based on the "plugin when a bigger screen is available theory". I don't mind osx, BSD is a fine unix core and home brew can suffice as a package manager. Admittedly, I'm a little biased towards Ubuntu now, but I'm not 100% satisfied with any of it's IDEs/code editors.

    Btw do you feed your posts to twitter or buzz in any way? I find I'm going there more than my RSS reader (weekly on RSS, daily on twitter, every other day on buzz).

  content: 'Macbook Air''s lack of dedicated mic-in kills it for me since I like to
    be able to line in with headphones on to record.  On OSX: being able to run some
    commercial programs like Photoshop natively is awesome, but I''ve always had more
    trouble getting the FOSS tools installed on OSX than in Linux.  Latest issue was
    with getting PyGame (Python module) installed which was a breeze in Ubuntu and
    near impossible on the Mac, but have had similar tussles with mySQL and lots of
    other tools which you''d think should be just as easy as anywhere else in the
    *nix world but aint.  So, its a love / hate relationship I have with Mac, but
    I certainly don''t regret using them.'

  content: I don't feed my posts to Buzz, FB, Twitter or anyplace anymore.  I was
    getting really annoyed that my posts were "frozen in time" on these other sites
    and subsequent changes I'd make to them weren't reflected out on those sites.  Also,
    all the comments made to my posts were tied up in some system I didn't control.   I
    have come around a little with Disqus and might consider adding it to my blog
    again because it allows me at the least to gather up the posts I make elsewhere
    in one place - and I highly approve of the fact that they offer a way to export
    them.  BUT, I'd rather just have OpenID working again (it broke after WP 3.0)
    since I really think thats the best solution.

  content: "I've been around the Disqus topic before, and every way I think about\r\nit
    the tool adds value.\r\n\r\nTo me as a blogger, Disqus commenters just jump in
    with an instant\r\nsense of community recognizing friendly faces of fellow commenters.\r\nTo
    commenters frictionless sign in, we can track down our updates\r\nwherever they
    are made, and even follow our friends comments as well.\r\nI love that feature,
    and pull that feed into my rss reader (open).\r\nOur comments are exportable and
    split between our blog and disqus (new\r\ncomments always show up in wordpress).\r\nSpammers
    are caught and tracked more easily.\r\nAnd finally and most importantly, I've
    grown to trust Daniel Ha one of\r\nthe cofounders of the platform."

  content: Can't reply to your comment above about Disqus (theres only a Like button
    no reply) but I've tried to install Disqus on WP3.0.1 twice and failed.  Each
    time it runs through the whole install, and it seems to be working (all existing
    comments got ported to Disqus ok too) but they are no longer visible in WP!  Since
    I obviously don't wanna lose all my existing comments, I have deleted the plugin.

    a test blog is a good way to make sure its working properly. I imported them,
    and went to my Disqus moderation panel to work everything out. It should never
    delete comments from your blog."

<ul>
<li>a mobile computer so I can engage in the ritual of hackathons</li>
<li>capable CPU</li>
<li>enough memory: 4GBytes+ is sufficient for my needs</li>
<li>TextMate, a nifty Mac OSX project editor that appears to nail every feature I want out of an IDE without any apparent bloat (backups of gedit, Netbeans, Aptana, visual studio express if needed)</li>
<li>long battery life</li>
<li>capable graphics processor, I'd like to be able to do wonderful things with 3D, animations/rendering, and games</li>
<li>Crisp resolution display. Ideally a bunch of Retina displays glued together, hmmm.</I>
<li>heavily supported package manager. homebrew works, apt-get isn't terrible, there are a number of solid ones available. I've compiled from source enough for several lifetimes ;)</li>
</ul>
<p>I realize any capable system can give me most of what I want, but I'd like this mobile computer to last a few years. Given those requirements I opted for a MacBook Pro 13" last weekend, but returned it after hearing a new MacBook Air came out yesterday in order to narrow down the trade space. I saved myself the download time for XCode and WoW (what a data beast) by copying them to a 320 Gbyte passbook.</p>
<p>The 13" model comes standard with a respectable battery life of 7 hours wifi but skipped the optical drive. This size MacBook Air can be configured with 256 GByte drive, a core 2 duo 2.13Ghz, and 4 GByte ram for $1799. That's pretty steep for a light mobile system these days, and I've read some <a href="http://mobile.computerworld.com/device/article.php?CALL_URL=blogs.computerworld.com/17204/new_2010_macbook_air_netbook_gets_lousy_reviews">critical</a> <a href="http://www.onlinesocialmedia.net/20101021/new-macbook-air-2010-review-roundup/">reviews</a> of the product. Tech fans get bored so we're easily entertained by BigCo (Apple, Google, etc) drama.</p>
<p>One interesting option I entertained briefly is to go with an iMac and a carrying pack. I won't need the system on a plane or train so an iMac serves as a powerful semi-mobile option. The big deterrents are a total sacrifice of mobility (no battery) and the vulnerable glass display, aka *SHATTER* system. Nice screen real estate though - 21" or 27".</p>
<p>The alternative is to trick out a different laptop, install Ubuntu or another flavor of open base OS, and add VMWare or VirtualBox to run Mac OS or Windows applications. Selecting a <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/63041-35-best-brand-laptop">brand</a> is a matter of location for me. If something does go wrong I'd like to know I can drop off the system nearby for a speedy repair. That's one random variable that Apple takes off the table by providing outstanding customer service, and is key to their success.</p>
