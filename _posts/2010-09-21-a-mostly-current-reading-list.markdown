<p>A mostly current reading list: (inspired by Josh Fraser's post <a href="http://www.onlineaspect.com/2010/07/23/my-3-rules-about-reading/#idc-container">http://www.onlineaspect.com/2010/07/23/my-3-rules-about-reading/#idc-container</a>)</p>
<p>I've been giving away books for years, awesome habit! I finally got  rid of all my old gaming books (hundreds) and they're in the trunk of my car now, ready to be dropped off at a nearby gaming store. Almost every  technical book, algorithmic book, or fun book that comes my way gets  stashed on my kindle ebook account, a pdf on dropbox, or now iOS apps.</p>
<p>Favorite trends/futurist tech book:<br />
Kevin Kelly's New Rules for the New Economy, preorded his next book created from the Technium, What Technology Wants</p>
<p>All time favorite fantasy book:<br />
The Great Book of Amber by Roger Zelazney (I read the series separately then got this awesome compilation of both series).</p>
<p>The books I'm actively reading or have read recently. My backlog is  growing much faster than I can read them (some of the books on my list):<br />

<p>Hopefully soon to be released, a future fantasy rpg I coauthored  primarily with one friend with input from another.
