<p>In previous posts I've mentioned <a href="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2009/05/04/short-term-survival-trumps-searching-for-our-calling-but-only-in-the-short-term/">Short Term Survival Trumps Searching For Our Calling, But Only in the Short Term</a>, the <a href="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2009/06/18/barriers-to-social-change/">Barriers to Social Change</a>, and most recently the <a href="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2009/06/28/agents-of-change/">Agents of Change</a>. But how do we move forward? This is the next concept in that series (tagged social change). It relates to manifesting the abstract ideas of making a difference by doing something you love. The goal is harnessing community effort into a real and positive societal shift.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of a short facebook conversation with my good friend Howard from my college years. Once again I was reminded how daunting the task of changing fields can be to a family person with fiscal responsibilities. We become pinned down by the costs of providing our loved ones with the best we can offer. The experience of transformation from a labor that pays the bills, to a labor of love will likely require outside investment. I was challenged to invent a method for people to change their careers, lifestyle, and businesses.</p>
<p>My first solution was a type of <a class="zem_slink" title="Venture capital" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital">venture capitalist</a> that was not purely profit motivated. But how could this work? The <a href="http://www.avc.com/">best venture capitalists</a> are rewarded financially by funding bright startups and mentoring their investment company's development. This framework would need a different type of investor all together. Part of the problem is how financial rewards work.</p>
<p>Amongst other ways, businesses earn money by having a market share, and selling products at a profit margin (by having cheap overhead/costs). People earn money by doing work for businesses (or themselves), or governments. The key value point we are missing: <strong>One isn't rewarded financially even though their efforts may positively impact the lives of a great number of other people. </strong>How can we correct this systematic inefficiency? Is it possible we under value life improvement on a large scale? Imagine no internet, no web, or no collaborative globally available encyclopedic information source. As an example, shouldn't the creators of HTTP, TCPIP, and wikipedia be greatly rewarded financially?</p>
<p>It is my belief that we can leverage the form of social crowd sourced loan structure suggested in the video above into a way of fueling our most passionate work. Not only in the most impoverished areas, but within all walks of life. The <a href="http://www.tacticsofhope.org/">Tactics of Hope</a> is an organization dedicated to making real, the message I have conveyed through many posts: matching passion with our daily work.</p>
