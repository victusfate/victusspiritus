<h1>The Swine Strikes Back?</h1>
<p>Wishful thinking wasn't enough to be free and clear of this year's flu back in <a href="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2009/09/23/the-seasonal-sickness-influenza/">September</a>.  That was before things jumped the shark, and schools closed. I heard this morning from <a href="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2009/09/29/familiarity-breeds-friendship/">Bill</a> at 7-11 that 160 kids were out sick yesterday at the local Port Jeff school. Take a few minutes to <a href="http://www.google.org/flutrends/">catch up on the flu trends</a> and you'll see how ruthlessly effective this years flu variants have been.</p>

<h1>Ruby on Rails</h1>
<p>Since I'm feeling terrible at home anyway, I decided this was a great time to dig into the Ruby on Rails tutorial mashup I had constructed from my web browsing. The Chief Tech of Victus Media Tyler has been kicking ass and taking names with RoR coding.  Sadly I haven't been able to dig my teeth into this web framework yet. I spent a few days banging my head on building the <a href="http://victus1.victusmedia.com">victus media intelligent search/ads code</a> locally with netbeans without success. I settled on starting with a simpler environment. Somehow during the netbeans setup, I mangled my gem directory and install of Ruby, so I started over and am following the advice here: <a href="http://beans.seartipy.com/2008/06/09/setting-up-rails-development-environment-on-windows-vistaxp/">Setting up Rails Development Environment on Windows Vista/XP</a> by tabrez. After that simple install (it worked!) I decided to go with <a href="http://beans.seartipy.com/2009/01/11/%E2%80%9Chello-world%E2%80%9D-web-application-in-ruby-on-rails-using-console/">“Hello, World” Web Application in Ruby on Rails using console</a> another great post by tabrez. I have since mixed in some MongoDB usage and am getting a gem error (no sqlite3), but there's plenty of documentation on how to use <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Ruby+Language+Center">mongoDB from Ruby here</a>.</p>
<p>I've endeavored to put together a list of documentation sources I have gathered to help first time Ruby on Rails users (yeah Ruby's new to me too). I should have this setup so others can edit and add on their favorite rails documentation. Here's the link to the <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AvdN0hRq3gdgdEM4dDhETFRONHZtaFFBWS1OY25OYkE&amp;hl=en">Google Spreadsheet</a>.</p>
