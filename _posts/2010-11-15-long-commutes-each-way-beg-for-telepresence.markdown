  content: "Totally agree that long commutes definitely do beg for telepresence capabilities
    and otherwise should be very infrequent activities.\n\nThat said, to secure new
    business I will always travel at least once, round-trip, for whatever distance
    and time is required in proportion to the potential increase in value of that
    potential business relative to anything available on my immediate doorstep. Longest
    example trip was either from the UK to Saudi Arabia or from LA to Munich - not
    sure which is greater distance but we did get the business in both cases so it
    paid off.\n\nHowever, the further the distance and longer the travel time that
    it takes to get to the client, the greater is the need for the resultant work
    commitment to be handled via Telepresence for neither I nor my partners will do
    any daily commute that takes longer than 40 minutes either way. \n\nBut that also
    means that we will happily use a Marriott Residence Inn option located close to
    the client if the potential return on time and expenses invested makes the whole
    deal well worth while.\n\nHey, we haven't invested in having our own subscriptions
    to GoToMeeting and Skype for nothing! Every day, the facilities are enhanced and
    improve for enabling effective conduct of business remotely. "

  content: Welcome and wise words on travel. There's nothing quite like it. The multi-day
    trip certainly makes the experience much more civilized, as opposed to the endless
    day trip. But getting home sooner is hard to beat.

    vision by reading it, though I haven't put any of it into practice.

<p>I was tight on time this AM, because of a 5 hour <em>commute</em> to a meeting a few hundred miles from home.* I haven't travelled for my job in a little over 5 years, but opportunity knocks.</p>
<p>Sharp organization leads remind us of the value of face to face meetings. Most builders (engineers, web hackers, etc) see greater than 30 minute meetings as a hefty time sink, a distraction that costs more than the meeting itself, not including travel time.</p>
<p>From the advent of the Internet and the rise of web collaboration, telepresence begged at the dreams of every commuter. As a would be entrepreneur and founder, this trip is a smack in the face by an incredible problem and tax on collaboration. I've heard of companies (Cisco) working on improved telepresence, but the costs for quality meetings is still very steep and nothing like actually meeting in person. Do you know of any other corporations working this problem?</p>
<p><em>Why I'm wrong and some meetings are worth any commute</em></p>
<p>The technical meeting was epic. I got to meet a group of incredible engineers. Beyond that I asked a thousand questions, and got solid answers to most of them. These folks oozed enthusiasm.</p>
<p>A few guys were fluent in the latest network architectures, interfaces, and even scripting languages (Python). I was introduced briefly to <a href="http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/">OpenCV</a>, a powerful open source computer vision library and I plan to share it with the guys at the office. One gentlemen had ten years experience (both good and bad) building and selling his own software company. Yup, you can find founders just about anywhere if you listen carefully.</p>
<p>Notes:<br />
*= a ten hour total commute is pretty long, but I've had longer single day trips. Round trip traveling coast to coast (NY-&gt;LA) started at 4:15 am and ended with the red eye back the next morning, with traffic filled ground  travel all to support a few hours of meetings. I've got nothing on the guys and gals who commute 3-8 hours regularly each day.</p>
