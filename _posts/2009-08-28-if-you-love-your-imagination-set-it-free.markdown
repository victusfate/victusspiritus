  you can't necessarily justify them or know where they're gonna go."

<p>Evan declares early in the video that he has learned to listen to his hunches:</p>

<p>If you are unsure of which direction your work and home life are headed you need simply look to your side projects. Many of us have hobby's outside of our daily responsibilities. Our hobby's embody our passions and interests in ways that our required activities are unable to. By letting go of the goal, and following our blossoming creations, we can tap into the creative power that has fueled human civilization for many thousands of years. If you find yourself at odds with making time for your passions, stop fighting yourself and let them go. You'll rediscover your inspiration when you most need it. <strong>Trying to funnel creativity down a preconceived path is like trying to redirect a flood with tissue paper</strong>. Respect the power of your imagination, and the wistful dreams of your spirit by giving your ideas the nourishment and freedom to grow.</p>
