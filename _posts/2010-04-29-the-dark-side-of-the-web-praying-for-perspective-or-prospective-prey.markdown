  content: 'Hey Mark. Interesting post... my comment focuses in on your comment about
    "Alternative Monetization Channels".<br><br>I have recently been reading a Ph.D
    thesis "Consumption of Virtual Goods" by Vili Lehdonvitra, inside of which is
    laid bare the motivations behind buying "Virtual Goods". Herein lies a good basis
    for understanding why people use Ad-block plus, and how websites can find alternative
    ways to make money from their communities.<br><br>The fact of the matter is, advertisements
    waste our time. The more intrusive they are, the more time they waste. As you
    most likely already are aware of, time is directly correlated with money, based
    on the relative value of money for each individual reader. When that time wasted
    reaches a certain threshold, it becomes prudent for us to seek a way to completely
    block out the wasted time.<br><br>Following this point, we see that nothing on
    the web is free. Even going to a webpage with absolutely no advertisements still
    costs us something. Our time. Currently, the only motivation for us to spend this
    time is content. However, there are many other virtual worlds besides traditional
    websites and blogs that have already begun to harness other motivations that can
    be created within a virtual space.<br><br>Before proceeding, let me outline the
    possible motivations for someone consuming a virtual asset, which can be a game
    item, an article on a blog, or a video on youtube.<br><br>Motivation 1: The virtual
    item has a utility value. It allows me to accomplish something I previously could
    not do within the real world, or a virtual world. An example of this is information
    on a website. After reading that information, I have a better understanding of
    the world, and can accomplish goals that I previously could not accomplish.<br><br>Motivation
    2: The virtual item has some sort of Emotional or Aethetic value. Many Youtube
    videos tap into this motivation. Seeing a beautiful video is in-of-itself a motivation
    for spending time.<br><br>Motivation 3: The virtual item improves my self-identity
    or social status within the virtual world, or the real world. An example of this
    is Blogging, where I spend my time blogging in the hopes of increasing my real
    world value (sometimes).<br><br>Where a virtual space is any "community" or "visual
    area" that can be created inside of a computer. This includes websites, the desktop,
    inside of games... everywhere.<br><br>Take a look at Habbo Hotel. This game has
    learned to harness the motivations underlying our virtual consumption (of which
    reading websites is one aspect) to a much deeper extent. Let&#39;s do a small
    comparison:<br><br><a href="http://Techcrunch.com" rel="nofollow">Techcrunch.com</a>
    (website)<br><br>Motivation for readers to visit the virtual world: <br>-Information
    with high Utility value<br>-Limited possibility of increased social status through
    making comments and/or providing tips to the website<br><br>What is monetized:<br>-Nothing
    is directly monetized. Advertisements make money on the website as an outcome
    of people spending time consuming the websites content. The monetization is seperate
    from the systems of content and social intercourse within the website. This makes
    it easy to avoid the monetization (advertisement) altogether... because, as ad-block
    has shown, since the monetization and the motivations for people coming to the
    website are completely seperate, one can be completely isolated from the other.<br><br>Habbo
    Hotel:<br><br>Motivations for users to visit the world:<br>-Increased social status
    through relationships created inside of the virtual world, possibility of transferring
    to the real world (based on who you meet)<br>-Emotional and/or aethetic qualities
    of the virtual items that increase based on the history of each item a user might
    be wearing. (some items are very old, and have had famous owners, increasing their
    inherent value). <br>-Utility value of some things allows some paid users to access
    different facets of the game world and to perform unique actions that have value
    because of the fact that they are not available to the majority of members. (private
    access to special rooms and such)<br>-The ability to empower one&#39;s self-identity
    through rare items and unique styles. Ability to reflect real world values in
    the virtual world. (and don&#39;t discount this fact... many goths would be happy
    to pay 20$ for the "goth" clothing in order to reflect their real-world social
    values in the virtual world)<br><br>What is monetized:<br>-Motivation for increased
    social status is directly monetized by requiring greater and greater amounts of
    money for increased rarity of items and uniqueness. It is also indirectly monetized
    by items that are only available temporarily, allowing people to establish themselves
    as a "veteran member" of the community through ownership of a unique, limited
    time offer virtual item.<br><br>-Motivation for self-identity is monetized through
    large selection of styles (all which must be paid for of course)<br><br>-Motivation
    for emotional/aethetic value is directly monetized through users having to pay
    more for more beautiful things. Additionally, emotional value is monetized through
    users paying a monthly cost to hold onto their "space"... like paying a rent to
    keep holding onto a prized house for example. The house represents all of the
    time i spent with my friends talking inside of the house, so it has an emotional
    value to me. Monetized monthly... habbo hotel is very smart :)<br><br>-Motivation
    for utility is handled by habbo directly monetizing the ability to perform actions
    and games within the virtual world.<br><br>As you can see, the problem with most
    websites is that as of yet there exists no system to directly monetize the alternative
    motivations that people can have for using them. In habbo hotel, a "ad blocker"
    would be useless, because the monetization is built DIRECTLY INTO the virtual
    items and properties that users have motivation to see/use.<br><br>In conclusion,
    moving forward, websites must involve their readers much more heavily and increase
    their interaction with their community in order to harness the motivations that
    people have for spending time, and money (effort) on virtual goods (goods including
    the articles and news that a website produces). This will eliminate their reliance
    on a parallel, easily blocked monetization system such as pure advertisements.<br><br>This
    will be rectified shortly by my company, I assure you. :)'

  content: Leland, first off massive props for the in depth and well thought comment.
    I&#39;ve been trying to connect virtual goods with our sense of value. The expression
    of our interests and the desire to shape and mold realities even virtual ones,
    transcends the value of "real" currency. At first I considered virtual goods somewhat
    skeptically. But now I accept that they are just as real as vanity purchases or
    style signals we exhibit from other real world clothing or goods.<br><br>I&#39;d
    love to hear more about your startup, certainly since it relates to a great need
    and if satisfied could very well shape the future of the web.

    and beautiful and rich domain. Can  you imagine having this conversation outside
    the confines of capitalism and money? <br><br>It feels to me like an injustice
    to humanity in general, and more importantly your personal humanity to limit your
    experience in this way!<br><br>:)<br>Ronen<br><br>p.s. you have done a terrible
    injustice to the word truth in this post!

    be a  <br>cause of much misunderstanding when communicating but respect that we  <br>each
    have personal truths and meaning. What is your take on the word  <br>and its value?

  content: It is more in my heart then it is in my mind... it&#39;s not so much a
    static/finite end result, rather a process of discovery and evolution ... which
    may explain why it is both such a heated topic and why there are so many interpretations
    and passionate wars fought in its name<br><br>Commenting on a blog does not fulfill
    my desire to listen and be heard... it is too limited a medium...so I won&#39;t
    pursue this further here ... I do hope that one day we have a chance to continue
    this face to face<br><br>... But I have been playing a game on twitter - quoting
    from a book I&#39;ve been reading that actully does dare to describe truth ...
    I am nearing the end of this experiment (as the book nears it&#39;s end)... after
    which I will be publishing a post that is a more fluent aggregation of all the
    twitter updates ... so, if you wish, I&#39;ll drop a comment here when that gets
    published :)

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/porfirio/2905439446/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3728" title="CorricellaHDRaltramonto" src="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/CorricellaHDRaltramonto.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>Besides a catchy title what the hell does it mean? My thoughts today aren't religious or spiritual, but instead are focused on the distribution of information through modern web media channels. By "praying for perspective" I'm writing about our ambitious need to consume all manner of information and in particular web media. This need is driven by several overlapping psychological and behaviorial motivators, of which I'll describe a few: state, curiousity, and perspective.</p>
<h2>Who's behind the wheel?</h2>
<p><em>You are.</em><br />
We share an instinct to stay informed and in touch with loved ones, friends, trends and less popular social memes. Beyond this fundamental social instinct many look to the web out of another primal need: curiousity. We improve our understanding of novel topics or assist our memory with details we once knew. Beyond the social need of belonging, and our natural curiousity is a quest for truth. The type of truth that can only come from critically comparing a wide variety of views on challenging social issues and philosophies. A semantic divergence of billions of nuances branch out from the the word truth. We each have a moving definition for this short word. For myself truth is <em>what is</em>. For others truth is what was, or what will be. For more rigid minds (not necessarily rational), Truth is absolute and others must submit to one version of reality. To others truth is a word of little value because of it's failure to transmit a clear meaning.</p>
<h2>So why all glum, Mr. Dark Side of the Web?</h2>
<p>Popular web businesses acutely understand the needs of belonging, curiousity, and perspective. And no matter how good intentioned these folks are, while they are building their startups and businesses they'll face a question: <em>How can the business best exchange visitor and content creator* attention in order to increase revenue?</em> There's an upper limit to ads that each of us will tolerate. Any ads over that limit result in lost or non repeating visitors. There's also a comfortable level of privacy that we require. Targeted ads are fine, as long as every business in the world doesn't have a full catalog of my tastes, friends, and contact information.</p>
<p>Consider for a moment what fraction of your attention is diverted by placement ads, interrupt ads, embedded ads and bill boards (my hypocrisy^). Now multiply that fraction by your life time. That's how much of your life was sacrificed by the inefficiencies of ad powered information. The web hasn't yet found a better path to fund "free" information flow.</p>
<h2>Alternative monetization channels</h2>
<p>There are tools like ad blocker available, but then you're basically robbing the site owner of the content value they provide. That's something any good capitalist can't stomach. Can we imagine a more efficient fuel to diminish the attention tax? We could create a massive pay portal based web. You log on from anywhere, visit any site, and it can negotiate a tiny fee from your subscription. If we desire information without ads we should have the ability to opt out. By removing the ad middle man from the equation we could have a more efficient information network. I'd love to hear about your ideas, as my next push in creating a web business is founded on building fully hackable, distributed social tools.</p>
<p>Notes:<br />
*= Most web browsers are creating some form of content. What are social web sites without people, and how much of the web is no longer social?</p>
<p>^= don't forget to visit Ars Vox for all your epublishing or blog to ebook needs. Aakin's a good friend, so any referral to him is more than just an ad, I'm doing you a favor by introducing you to his skills. Also my first shake at a web business is built on targeted ad model, <a href="http://victusmedia.com">Victus Media</a>.</p>
