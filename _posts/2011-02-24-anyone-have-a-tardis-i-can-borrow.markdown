  content: One unintended good result of the TSA's shenanigans is encouraging use
    of video conferencing and screen sharing in lieu of air travel. With a bigger
    audience and available money freed up from the travel budget, these services should
    continue to improve.

  content: That's welcome news. We opted for Skype today, any other screen sharing
    utilities you suggest Denny? Tyler and I used an adobe one a while back but I
    haven't tried it recently.

    Good stuff!

    For the record, it's about 45 minutes from my location to the city...not sure what it is from the city to your side of the world...but the longest it's taken me to get to your side of the world was 4 hours (from my house to Bayshore on a holiday weekend with gobs-o-accidents killing traffic)...of course that being said, I can get from my house in NJ to my hometown (all the way on the other side of PA) in about 6 hours...so 4 hours is a bit insane =D

    Oh and we do have an API...we just haven't released it to the general public yet (and now I have to double-check the Twitter situation as they are getting sticky with the T.O.S. of their stuff)...

  content: "Without traffic it's about an hour and 20 from my house to manhattan.
    \r\n\r\nso ideally it'd be 1:20 + cross manhattan + 45. That's not too bad, but
    traffic would boost that by a margin. Longer days would make it better (leave
    at 5am on a summer day and camp out until night post traffic, drive home in zombie
    mode)"

<p><I>Planning a daytrip</I></p>
<p>A talented web slinging friend of mine (not Spiderman) is developing a slick social interest filtering platform. I met with founder <a href="http://twitter.com/falicon">Kevin Marshall</a> a couple of weeks back to get the inside scoop on <a href="http://knowabout.it">KnowAbout.it</a>, a young project he and <a href="http://twitter.com/willcole">Will Cole</a> have been working tirelessly on refining into a must have social utility. After an hour of walking and freezing, we finally found a spot in a bookstore in lower Manhattan. </p>
<p>Kevin took me on the staircase tour of KnowAbout.it, and after discussing what it can currently provide, I was excited to see how I could build on their infrastructure. The app aggregates social shares in order to be the best <I>good stuff detector</I>, and it's setup to improve with personal feedback (yes!). This signal detector begs for an API* to elevate obscure but fascinating information out of noisy channels.</p>
<blockquote><p>
The core concept of Know About It is surfacing interesting content that flows through your social stream
</p></blockquote>
<p>I planned on a visit to Kevin's secret lair deep in the bowels of New Jersey to have a good ole hack session this week.</p>
<p><I>Last night I plotted the course</I></p>
<p>Reality struck like a baseball bat in the face. The shortest distance was a 90 mile route through Manhattan which is begging for trouble. The highway options which wrap north (cross bronx) and south (belt parkway) are at best a nightmarish test of patience. The drive in and out were rush hour synchronized for gratuitous gridlock pain. The minimum car sitting frustration for the trip clocked in at 6 hours (round trip), the more reasonable estimate was 7 hours. I shot out a "oh god no" email to Kevin last night. I look forward to screen sharing, and in the near future meeting at a coworking space in Manhattan, where we can sit down, talk and stare at code like gentlemen :).</p>

<p>Notes:<br />
*= why an API? imagine feeding this data hungry beast your DropBox folder, Instapaper bookmarks, couchDBs, etc</p>
