    Hey Mark

    11 or 13 inch? I'm leaning towards an 11 inch for travel and still deciding so your input is appreciated.

    My understanding is that the air doesn't have a Firewire port so I guess its a wireless or USB sync. That to me is a drawback but not a deal killer.

    Enjoy

  content: "Huh, guess my lack of a FireWire is no hindrance then. I prefer the larger
    real estate with the 13\", but your mileage may vary. I added 2Gbytes for 4Gbytes
    of ram total and the slightly faster processor for the 256Gbyte solid state flash
    drive.\r\n\r\nI assume you'll use it to check mail, compose messages, and modify
    presentations. Either size will work, but again I'm a biased screen real estate
    hog for development and other apps. Not sure of the portability advantage of 11
    vs 13. Both should fit in your lap on a long flight.\r\n\r\nThe great news, everything
    I use it for is snappy and responsive. It can replace my massive desktop for pretty
    much everything. That's impressive."

My brand spanking new MacBook Air arrived a day earlier than expected, shipped directly from Shanghai, but no one was home to receive it. I got an email from Apple midday that FedEx would try to deliver the Air for two more days. I chose the quickest option picking it up at the depot last night. Setup this time was incredibly smooth since I went through the effort with an <a href="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2010/10/25/mac-osx-snow-leopard-vs-ubuntu-linux-lucid-lynx-week-one/">iMac</a> last week. The process took a few hours of automagic synching between my iMac and the Air, mostly due to being over wifi. I don't own a firewire and World of Warcraft (WoW) is 20gigs or so, XCode is 3Gigs, and my music and other applications took up the remainder.</p>
<p>When I logged on to the laptop this morning at 5:30 am everything worked. The command line dev stuff was ready to rumble: Ruby Version manager, Ruby 1.9.2, Rails 3, soca for couchDB apps. I may need to setup another key for git which I'll find out later. </p>
<p>All my other apps worked fine: TextMate, Chrome, Chromium, CouchDB*, Dropbox, and WoW. I haven't run any benchmarks yet, but I'm impressed by how good the graphics are on WoW. Based on the integrated graphics (Gforce 320M) I expected stuttering game play, yet was happily surprised by silky smooth rendering. I haven't been to Dalaran or a busy area to push it, but the buzz of the fan coming to life when playing is obvious. My quantum dreams of writing a Rick Roll addon in lua are collapsing into reality. If that doesn't work there's always custom sponsored gear overlays and tatoos - "Raid with the most hang time, raid with Nike Air boots".</p>
<p>Notes:<br />
*= I had an error with CouchDB on my iMac twice last week. After setting up continuos synchronization to Max Ogden's and Tyler Gillies' couchappspora nodes, it would crash after a few hours. I clipped the error message into a text file for later review. In the meantime I spotted <a href="http://janl.github.com/couchdbx/">Jan Lenhardt's nightly Mac OS X couchDB builds</a>. I expect an update will clear up stability problems. CouchDB has run for days on my ubuntu system without so much as a hiccup.</p>
