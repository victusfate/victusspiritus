  content: Recommend doing your exercise first thing and consistently. That way, no
    matter what else happens in the day, you're at least taking better care of your
    body. No excuses can crop up during the day to put it off. I've also found that
    a little every day is better than a lot once or twice a week (which works well
    for things like yoga, might not work as well for things where physical recovery
    is needed, like running).

  content: That's precisely what I do, 3-4hours walking from 6am on has been a steady
    habit of mine for a couple of years. It really makes me feel great the rest of
    the day. Just gotta reel in my eating habits.

  content: "That's a constant struggle for me too :)\nIt's the late dinner that's
    a killer because you don't need all those calories if you're just going to bed
    soon. And, from my limited understanding, your body tends to turn calories into
    fat while you sleep rather than burn them while you're active. \nOne thing I've
    found helpful is being mindful of every bite - really chewing and paying attention
    to the taste and texture of things. It slows you down and you're giving the body
    time to recognize when it's full. But also, I've noticed that I need to eat less
    found when I focus like that (which could be because of noticing when full, but
    feels different than the 'i'm done bell')."

  content: Hey, I appreciate the tip. My wife and family just tell me "eat slower".
    I think being mindful of the food may work better for me.

  content: I find that if I've been hacking on code for 12 hours and start to get
    really tired, if I go run four miles then I'm awake and ready to keep cranking
    out code for a few more hours. Running is truly like a drug. I hate doing it,
    but love the feeling afterward.

<p>One of my professional goals is to extract every ounce of productivity from each day. Unfortunately, I've allowed my health and fitness to take a back seat to work. This is a common problem for tech folks who work long hours and have little time to balance exercise and diet. This post is a wake up call to myself and a friendly reminder to folks who become so focused on one goal that they ignore their health. When you're younger you may get away with ignoring your body. Now that I'm in my later thirties, I understand how and when my body and mind perform at peak efficiency, but have allowed my fitness to slip.</p>
<p><em>Keep Marching Forward, Each Step a Little Victory</em></p>
<p>My regular ten to fourteen mile morning walks have gotten a little tougher over the past year. I confess to adding significant <em>extra padding</em>, like a bear preparing for hibernation (30-40lbs). I skip breakfast during the week and eat a balanced lunch*. Long working days have lead to late dinners where I eat much more than I should. My wife's a fantastic cook and baker which further increases the challenge of eating light.</p>
<p><em>Fitness is critical to productivity</em></p>
<p>Good health acts as an amplifier on all other activities. Concentration, drive, and effort are all at peak performance when we are fit. On the other hand, being less fit is a tax on every action. Between diminished enthusiasm and lethargy the cost is severe. On top of those costs, as fitness declines we become more prone to injury. I submit my lower back as a painful example.</p>
<p><em>Life Hacking</em></p>
<p>Maintaining fitness requires discipline, yet I have little in reserve after 15 hour days.  I can clearly see where my daily habits go non-linear, leaving me with an opportunity to hack my own habits. The point in the day where I'm slipping (8pm) and dinner are the beach head I'll target.</p>
<p>This week I'll eat dinner earlier whenever possible, and in the cases when I can't I'll guzzle a pint of water before eating to trigger an earlier feeling of satisfaction. Beyond that I'll squeeze in breakfast to shift my calorie consumption earlier and kick start my metabolism.</p>
<p>Notes:<br />
*= a healthy lunch for me consists of a small sandwich, carrots, snack bar &amp; fruit</p>
