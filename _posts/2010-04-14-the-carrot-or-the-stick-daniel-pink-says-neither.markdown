  content: Hmm, very interesting video. I&#39;m kind of experiencing this myself right
    now:<br><br>I am scheduled to take an actuary exam in late May, and I need to
    read and work through this book, but I find that every time I try to study from
    it, I feel exhausted, and quit very quickly. <br><br>On the other hand, I got
    a Ruby programming book for fun, and have been working at a pretty good pace through
    it so far.

  content: I hit walls all the time, but for the stuff that&#39;s important and that  <br>jives
    with my interests those barriers are more like speed bumps than  <br>great barriers.
    Glad you&#39;re enjoying Ruby and programming!

<p><I>As a proto-founder and inspiration blogger Dan's TED talk caught my interest from a couple of directions. Happiness, enthusiasm, productivity, efficiency, and satisfaction are all concepts that I mull over on any given day. Plus I had this video embedded in a draft at home and it's 30 degrees so my fingers are going numb from typing on my phone. Enjoy!</I><br />

<h2>Intrinsic versus Extrinsic Motivators</h2>
<p>There could be a correlation between the <a href="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2009/08/22/optimal-design-performance-under-stress/">stress response</a> induced from heavily rewarded behavior, and the procedural thinking that dominates focused, predictable work. It's pretty shocking to hear that rewards can diminish performance.</p>
<p>Here's the priorities Daniel Pink describes as optimal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Autonomy: self direction</li>
<li>Mastery: confidence and skill set</li>
<li>Purpose: does the work matter</li>
</ul>
<p>Another cool work philosophy covered by Dan:</p>
<h2>ROWE: results only work enviornment</h2>
<ul>
<li>Only priority: get their work done</li>
<li>People don't have schedules</li>
<li>meetings optional</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.lessonsoffailure.com/developers/autonomy-mastery-purpose/">Dave's much better write up</a> of LessonsOfFailure.com on this topic for clueing me in.</p>
