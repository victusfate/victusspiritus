  content: 'The CEO of Branch Banking & Trust, noted some of these effects, as well
    as others that we are just recently seeing, such as strategic defaults and interest
    rate issues, in a letter to House and Senate members in September of 2008. He
    also points out that the Treasury is highly tied to these Wall Street members,
    which is likely why they managed to profit from the bailouts, while harming the
    smaller guys.<br><br>The letter and comments on it can be read here: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/74i9g/sorry_its_a_pdf_but_must_read_a_responsible_bank/"

    biggest thing I get from this post, is that not everything is understandable,
    even to smart people, let alone the regular consumers. If we really expect people
    to know what is going on and how it impacts not only them personally, but businesses,
    we need to simplify the text. Everyone should have the right to know what is going
    on, with out needing it to be processed and retransmitted.<br><br>Disclaimer:

  content: 'Before reading any comments, I want to get my thoughts about this particular
    side of our economy off my chest.<br><br>For starters, it drives me crazy that
    we would set up an economic system where CEO&#39;s and the elite make hundreds
    of times more money in a year then an average worker makes in THEIR ENTIRE LIVES.<br><br>Is
    this what capitalism all about? Driving the division between rich and poor ever
    more farther apart? From a brief glance at the system, and taking recent events
    into account, I think it is safe to say that any sane observer would conclude
    that having money, almost always, breeds more money. This means that the elite
    and the winners of small industries and local areas will just keep growing and
    growing.<br><br>Because I have enjoyed games throughout my life, I will put this
    to a game metaphor. The current state of our economy is like playing a game of
    world of warcraft where hardcore PVP mode is turned on and it is possible to go
    into negative levels after you die. Additionally, 3% of the population starts
    at level 80 with legendary equipment, 50 000 gold and can use flying mounts in
    every area. If you start off at level one, sure you might get a few levels, but
    sooner or later you are going to get killed off by someone who started with an
    advantage over you.<br><br>This is exactly the state of our current capitalist-driven
    economy! The elite families of the world control a massive percentage of all of
    our worlds wealth! How can someone compete against all of that power? The answer
    is: they can&#39;t! The fact that our governments do not actively work to redistribute
    wealth throughout the economy means that winners keep going on to more success
    and hogging ever-growing percentages of the economy while the losers are stuck
    poor and dejected. I would go as far to say that being born into a rich family
    now is almost the same as being born into the nobility 300 years ago. The only
    difference is that the base-line quality of life for poor people has gone up.
    <br><br>The problem, however, is that as long as the quality of life for poor
    people is kept above a certain threshold, they will never be strongly motivated
    to fight tooth and nail for their piece of the pie. In some ways, the horrible
    living conditions that lead up to the french revolution (and subsequent revolutions)
    was a good thing! It motivated people to fight for wealth redistribution! Without
    that motivation, how are we supposed to ever redistribute the wealth? The modern
    media tools we have available to us are only playthings of the elite... they control
    the media... the government. What we need is a truly democratic action and news
    system (like blogs) that has the reach to FORCE news into the mainstream. Blogs
    are like this now, but any potentially damaging news is still kept under the radar
    of most citizens due to the efforts of the major media conglomerates (the conglomerates
    that control nearly all forms of professional reporting to the American public).<br><br>Perhaps
    our role as innovators in the social and communications space should be about
    trying to bring on the era of a new form of social government that can redistribute
    wealth and empower people on all levels of the totem pole. <br><br>Sure, I agree
    that success should be rewarded, but not to the grotesque extents that it has
    been taken to under the capitalist system. I believe that if we are able to create
    a system that empowers people and social movements, and is resistant to elitist
    and government control, we can help bring about real change.<br><br>Too big to
    fail... so true. How can you lose when you have enough power to directly influence
    the markets? Enough power to exploit the officials that run the game (system)?

    trouble to post it. Perhaps ironic that I was actually initially just checking
    your blog re your "Why VC&#39;s prefer firing" tweet this morning, having previously
    read Fred Wilson&#39;s observations, and then I noticed this item. <br><br>My
    original reply included additional "rant" along the lines of Leland&#39;s and
    James comments but with discretion being the better part of valor, I decided to
    stick with just letting you all know about the CNBC docudrama. I also retweeted
    and fb&#39;s your blog; you do good stuff. {grin}'

    Allison may have underestimated the scope of the credit crisis a little). Incidentally,

  content: He may have, but then again to be fair, did anyone know the overall scope
    of the credit crisis? In under two weeks, from initial big name collapses of AIG
    and Lehman, we had legislation, this was written within the first week. It&#39;s
    still very interesting how he pointed out several of the issues we&#39;ve had
    recently, though. <br><br>It was on several blogs at the time, none mainstream,
    that I know of. I read it maybe a day or two prior to legislation.

  content: In August of &#39;07, when the securitization market for mortgages first
    froze up, assuming that the credit crisis was limited to subprimes (or subprimes
    and Alt-A mortgages) seemed to be a fairly common position. But by October of
    &#39;08, when I blogged about Allison&#39;s letter, pundits generally had a more
    expansive view of the credit crisis. Allison (and the economist/bloggers I linked
    to in that post) had something of a contrarian position, arguing that the real
    economy (Main Street) wasn&#39;t more broadly affected.<br><br>In fact, our economy
    had been fueled largely by a decades-long debt bubble that included other sectors
    besides real estate (e.g., consumer credit, education). Back in &#39;08, I <a
    href="http://thehackensack.blogspot.com/2008/10/next-bubble-to-burst-in-deleveraging.html"
    rel="nofollow">asked</a> whether education would be the next bubble to burst.
    Now, <a href="http://steamcatapult.com/2010/06/07/glenn-reynolds-realizes-theres-an-education-bubble/"
    rel="nofollow">mainstream pundits</a> are joining that bandwagon.

  content: I agree that it could be spotted, I remember occurrences of preeminent
    signs on mainstream news as far back as late-&#39;05 and it accelerated through
    the middle of &#39;08. Of course, it was just glimpses here and there, what 15-18yo
    actually wants to keep an eye on economic news, so I don&#39;t know much about
    what the pundits were seeing at the time, but I would have agreed at the time
    Main Street wasn&#39;t effected, though it was. <br><br>I also wrote about the
    education bubble, <a href="http://theinnovationist.com/2008/08/college-is-taxing-the-system/"
    rel="nofollow">here</a>, in &#39;08, and I&#39;ve followed it for a while, it
    crops up ever 2-3 months, and the frequency is constantly increasing. I actually
    left school because I didn&#39;t want to end up with an education that went underwater,
    along with some personal issues.

  content: 'To your first response above James, quote "The biggest thing I get from
    this post, is that not everything is understandable, even to smart people", I
    believe it is worth remembering that Greenspan himself, after retiring, all but
    gleefully observed that during his "reign" he often spoke before congressional
    committees in words that he chose deliberately to obfuscate and leave the listeners
    wondering what they had heard but afraid to question his words lest they seem
    less well educated and intelligent by so asking. <br>a) There is, and can be,
    absolutely no doubt that he is "brilliant". <br>b) Given how smart he is, there
    is equally no doubt that he is prevaricating once again when he, in more recent
    past, has said "nobody could have foreseen the coming crash"!!! or words to that
    effect. <br>To that last remark, in polite company, the only response has to do
    with Bulls and their excrement ~ otherwise rubbish! <br>Secondly, to Dave&#39;s
    point: quote "In fact, our economy had been fueled largely by a decades-long debt
    bubble that included other sectors besides real estate (e.g., consumer credit,
    education)."; true that. Living in the San Diego area watching house prices rise
    over a number of years at seemingly astronomical rates for "overall quality of
    living" that was effectively ever going lower while sizes were rapidly approaching
    that of mini castles would make even The Donald happy, has been a surreal experience.
    <br>Who, we kept wondering, was getting the salary increases commensurate with
    the level necessary to pay the end-game monthly costs for the vast ranges of $600K+
    plus mortgages? <br>Housing costs in SD are extortionately high (even today) compared
    to nationwide but average salaries have not proportionately risen nor are they
    proportionately higher than elsewhere. Hence a rash of bankruptcies and foreclosures
    was simply a matter of when not if and for Greenspan or any of his ilk to claim
    it was not foreseeable is radically false bordering upon malicious, culpable malfeasance.
    But then we must also remember that Greenspan, members of congress and senate
    and denizens of wall street all got way ahead of the rest of us so I guess they
    are well insulated from reality that affects the rest of us who are the ones actually
    paying their salaries and bonuses.'

<h2>Finance terminology sails over my head</h2>
<p>I was left a little bewildered by what exactly was going on in <em>Big Banking</em> after reading an <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2010/06/03/goldman-sachs-citigroup-markets-lenzner-morgan-stanley_print.html">article from Forbes </a> yesterday (via <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>). Here's the article introduction, it's worth reading in full but is much clearer to non-finance folks after reading the explanation in the second half of this post.</p>
<blockquote><p>Focus hard on this shocking Wall Street reality: The top six bank holding companies earned an aggregate of $51 billion in pretax income in 2009. We're talking about JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Wells Fargo.</p>
<p>All of this pretax income can be attributed to their trading revenues of $59.7 billion. The proprietary trading operations of an oligopoly of banks, saved from disaster by Uncle Sam's largesse and subsidized with cheap money from the central bank, was the single driving force behind the restoration of their fortunes and the renewed surge in their stock prices.</p>
<p>For those willing to go long when the outlook was the bleakest, they've banked a double in JPMorgan Chase, scored a quadruple in Citigroup and nearly a quintuple in BofA.</p>
<p>Some of the other 980 bank holding companies--like Bank of New York Mellon, PNC Financial Services, U.S. Bancorp and M&amp;T Bank--lost an aggregate of $19 billion for the 2009 year. Bank of New York Mellon had the seventh-largest trading revenue--it was just 1.6% of the total. By comparison, Goldman Sachs had 36.2%, Bank of America 18.8%, JPMorgan Chase 15.4%, Morgan Stanley 11.3%, Citigroup 6.9% and Wells Fargo 4.2%.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm very fortunate to have great friends like <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dpinsen">Dave Pinsen</a> to explain in simple language just how huge banks are generating revenue while the government (and our tax dollars) cover their risk. Only a few minutes after asking this financial expert (my words not Dave's) I received a clear and concise email back translating the article into language I could readily understand. It was so good of an explanation, that I asked to Dave to share the write-up with his blog community and he obliged in his post, <a href="http://steamcatapult.com/2010/06/05/six-apart/">Six Apart</a>. Here's an excerpt of the post:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, in a nutshell: the end result of government rescues of the banking system has been to strengthen an oligopoly where:<br />
– Too big to fail firms become even bigger, so the fall of any one of these would be an even bigger blow to the economy.<br />
– They make most of their money day trading their own book, so successfully that for all intents and purposes the game appears to be rigged.<br />
– Smaller banks haven’t benefited much.<br />
– The real economy hasn’t benefited much (because most of what the big banks are doing is trading their own book, instead of providing capital for productive companies to expand).</p></blockquote>
<p>Dave's the creative force behind <a href="http://portfolioarmor.com/">Portfolio Armor</a> an investment tool for hedging your bets, and <a href="http://shortscreen.com/">ShortScreen</a> as you may have guessed from the name, a tool to aid short selling.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I'm not an affiliate of Dave's nor do we exchange money in any way. I just dig his style, and one day look forward to partnering up with Dave for something great ;)!</p>
