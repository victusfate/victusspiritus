  content: Mark, I hear you on this.<br><br>I&#39;m living in Korea and for the first
    two weeks it was basically lying on the floor with a blanket and a pillow (that&#39;s
    the modus operandi in Korea for sleeping o_O). For those first two weeks I woke
    up at least four or five times every night.<br><br>Even after two weeks of sleeping
    on the floor, I still was not even close to used to it, so once I finally got
    to my permanent residence here I bought a spring queen mattress. Thank God for
    that. Even still, whenever I go to a motel or low-cost hotel here I can never
    have a good nights sleep... the mattresses are just too hard.<br><br>I think when
    it comes to sleeping, our bodies are rigidly conditioned based on where we have
    spent most of our time sleeping. I would expect if someone wants to change their
    bed it&#39;s going to take at least a few weeks.<br><br>Ouch. :)<br><br>By the
    way, you should try some drinks based on coconut while you are there... my Uncle
    lived there for awhile and said the coconut tasted great.

  content: Last nights Luau was free refill mixed drinks. Neither Michelle nor I  <br>drink
    but we tried out plenty of cocunut mixes. Great suggestion  <br>though, they were
    superb.

<p>In the past two days, I've undergone a drastic shift in my perspective of vacations. The changes were brought on by traveling to the gorgeous island of Maui. Just getting here was an exhausting 14 hours of sitting. I'll take a good hike any day over extended sit sessions. We arrived to soothing air and gorgeous weather. Even though Maui and her locals have given us a warm reception there are some difficulties that are detracting from my enjoyment of the trip.  </p>
<p>After three nights on the island, I have yet to get a good nights sleep. It's just not my home. At our home on Long Island we have a king sized tempur pedic mattress on the floor, at out hotel here we sleep on a "normal" queen sized spring bed about 3 feet off the ground. It will take me some time to become adjusted to the new sleeping conditions. My mom said I could never sleep while I was out with her as a baby, I always needed to go back to my crib. Thirty six years later this hasn't changed. It takes me a while to feel at home in a new place.</p>
<p>Michelle and I haven't had any luck finding a good hike. We have found gorgeous mini walks (1 mile scenic walks) but nothing on the 3-4 hour walking in paradise we had imagined. We'll rectify this tragedy today ;).</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong><br />
We've been out walking for an hour and I feel much better. A few more hours walking and I should be able to mellow out by beach and pool the rest of the day!   </p>
