<p>The cost of exchanging a message is the time of its composition, and the attention of its recipient(s). Modern mobile devices are capable of sending and receiving information over ad hoc networks, and distributed software is capable of routing the data, therefore the cost of sending and receiving additional messages is near zero (power). The added value of a middle tier which merely bottlenecks connectivity is forced to zero.</p>
<p>The rise of social networks, telecom providers, and monolithic information companies are built on an outdated value system. Clients are deceived into believing that they need the business to communicate with friends, family or to discover new folks to share ideas with. </p>
<p>The major information and telecom companies are racing to capture not only our address books, but all the analytics they can about individual and aggregate user behavior, in order to lock clients into their products and platform. This deep intelligence advantage acts as a virtual moat against potential competitors.</p>
<h2>Data Discrimination</h2>
<p>Group action can and will force businesses to change. A coordinated effort to cancel phone and data plans will drive telecom to deliver the cheapest bit independent of the color of data. Alternative free social platforms (open source) which are defined by protocols and interfaces, not by corporate boundaries, will drive competition in a different direction. </p>
<p>Where businesses can provide value is with software that improves the experience of communicating, by filtering spam and delivering timely high quality suggestions. Corporations can build more effective devices which act as mobile network hubs. The rise of ad hoc networks will eventually encapsulate and eclipse legacy client server hierarchies.</p>
<p><strong>We will no longer be on the Internet, we'll be the Internet.</strong></p>
<p><em>Notes:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Wireless ranges would gap fill far better than current wifi range. Broader bandwidths will allow for long range independent connectivity, which is required for full coverage.</li>
</ul>
