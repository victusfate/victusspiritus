  content: "We kind of think that talent is a rare commodity but watching people like
    Bryson Andres teaches me that we might not know how to look - and we do that because
    we don't do enough of allowing ourselves to enjoy the spontaneity and surprise
    - as is clearly this video achieves.\n\nFor spontaneity and surprise is way than
    a momentary thing, it is invitation to find out more.  That is exactly what I
    did.  So my first surprise in doing that was that Bryson was from Alaska.  That
    led me to ask myself - what the heck do I know about Alaska?  The answer is not
    surprising, very little.\n\nThe first port of call for me was to find an Alaskan
    site that featured Bryson Andres, and here I selected the Alaska Teen Media Institute. 
    It is a media site for 12 to 19 year olds and a great example that there is more
    to discover and find today online - if we can muster the risk to look.\n\n<b>Alaska
    Teen Media Institute</b>\nhttp://alaskateenmedia.org/drupal/audio/bryson-andres\n\nWhen
    I look at the font used on the site there, it is a font which must surely be typically
    Alaskan because I have seen it used in the legendary series whose location and
    backdrop was Alaska.  That of course is the incredibly original series that was
    once called Northern Exposure.\n\n<b>\"The Light\" Clip from Northern Exposure</b>
    \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2TPMoP01Sc\n\nLet say that Bryson Andres becomes
    more well known, even a famous Alaskan.  The final question I posed myself today
    was \"What and Who is a Famous Alaskan?\".   I immediately placed a cavaet to
    that question i.e. a famous Alaskan who has not been made famous by the antics
    of the Palin family.  \n\n<b>Wikipedia - List of People from Alaska</b>\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_from_Alaska\n\nIt
    is here, looking among the names and even pictures on the Wikipedia page for people
    from Alaska, I realized how little we know especially if our preoccupation becomes
    a search for \"fame\".  When we occupy our minds with the famous, and yet ponder
    the list of who is considered famous in Alaska, it merely points out to us a truth
    - that we only a know place by it's \"stars\" but not it's light.  \n\nTo shine
    light on Alaska, whenever a region of the country is defined by the few, a simple
    study of a wikipedia page should provide us enough humility to grasp the universe
    of fame that escapes us and that we don't know.  This is why being mesmerized
    is such a good thing, instead of opening the door to the next famous person, it
    opens the door to a brand new human soul.  \n\nSo if that is the case, watching
    the people who pass Bryson in the video and what they are doing in relationship
    to the performance, is even more insightful.  Then we find that we don't have
    to think in Alaskan terms to realize people are at a deeper level more like us
    than different from us.  We want to appreciate diversity, but what kills diversity
    is fame - that is why something fresh and invigorating such as this show of talent
    is required.\n\nIt is required, because it might just open our eyes to a much
    bigger prize, to spot the talent around us that won't show up on a you-tube video. 
    The bigger prize is an appreciation of both talent in the wider context and our
    ability to appreciate new frontiers - talent as an individual, Alaska as a group.\n\n<b>[Em]</b>\n\"Emeri
