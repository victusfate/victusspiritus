  content: "I purchased a book at Oliver Tambo Airport in 2008 and finally this year
    I got to read it by freeing myself from a largely time bound existence.   \"The
    Long Walk to Freedom\" by Nelson Mandela is written literally by a man who had
    plenty of time on his hand in Robben Island, composing thoughts that had to be
    hidden in a prison yard and then smuggled out.  From that came what I now regard
    as probably the ultimate in books about freedom as a lived experience - and my
    take from it is that as a lived experience, it is about the struggle that defines.\n\nWhat
    surprised me most about Mandela's book is that he does not shy away from his faults
    and because he genuinely see's himself as an ordinary man living in extraordinary
    circumstances, our conceptions of freedom have celebrated him among the leading
    lights of the fight for freedom.  Freedom therefore me resonates as a lived experience
    and not as an intellectual, ideological or imaginative exercise.  Those who have
    the time to go through the 700+ pages of Mandela's book, there is going to be
    an altering of one's perception of freedom, because the autobiography of Nelson
    Mandela is a rare gem of a lived experience.\n\nThe most incredible moment in
    the book for me is where Mandela accepts the struggle as a shaper of the lives
    that are today celebrated in South Africa as people who gave their all in the
    name of seeking freedom.  He is genuinely humble to his prison guards, regretting
    that he did not give his guards the opportunity to say good-bye when he left prison
    to a maelstrom of media attention.  The book outlines that Mandela on his journey
    was accompanied by people who he knew were greater than himself, but how history
    finally sifts our memories of liberation define our own judgment. \n\nThe book
    outlines most of all for me is that the act of freedom is not for the faint hearted,
    those that are not risk takers in the prison of worldly comforts can sacrifice
    freedom for a little morsel of pleasure, but those that understand the price of
    freedom, humility and reconciliation are among the values which keep freedom alive. 
    Where does money sit in that equation?  Mandela answers that in the book that
    it comes with the territory and if I look at my own words that I type out here,
    the words \"price\" and \"freedom\" sit together, as does the words \"value\"
    and the words \"cost\".  \n\nWhat we do with wealth is itself a freedom.  I am
    sure that those that are called the \"Greatest Generation\" who gave up their
    lives in World War II in the name of freedom, would be appalled at the choices
    that may or may not be made by the children of freedom, but then again isn't most
    freedom struggles in the name of providing an opportunity or a chance for the
    next generation?\n\nThe magic of Mandela's words in \"The Long Walk to Freedom\"
    are that they are real, clearly written from the heart as much as these words
    are written from the heart and in the end he leaves us with a lived experience
    which simply ensures that we don't repeat history, that his struggle informs our
    own and at the same time, reminds us also of our relative paradise.  Even today
    in South Africa, a level of fear is palpable and ever-present, it is a type of
    existence that we in the West simply take for granted - we do take freedoms won
    for granted, and when I worked with veterans of D-Day, one man who remembers the
    young kids who died in that fight did not have to say a word, his blue eyes filled
    up with tears and I knew better to shut up and simply understand his pain.\n\nWe
    have had thousands of years of guidance of what freedom means, but probably very
    little personal enlightenment what freedom is.  Writing these thoughts out would
    be something I consider a freedom, for I probably could not do this in Libya or
    in China or in Columbia, but I can do it where I live - yet only to the level
    of maturity that any given national boundary supports - at some point I probably
    will encounter a sanction, a prejudice, a censorship or a condemnation - if that
    is that my quest to live \"freedom\" is offensive to anyone whose actions will
    serve to deny it.\n\nIt is not freedom or living in paradise which is important
    for me, but the grace of it.  Can I truly experience the grace of it?  In that
    I think lies the nuclei of freedom and the DNA of the free.\n\n[Em] "

  content: " At the core essence of freedom we coexist with all these unfortunate
    aspects of existence and those that truly choose freedom always will walk a less
    traveled path.  Douglas Rushkoff is one person who see's the base reality of the
    human condition as a form of programming.   That fits with my own attitude that
    we are biological machines who is programmed to create things in our own image,
    that image being our imagination, constructed from programming called \"thoughts\".
     \n\nDouglas Rushkoff - Program or being Programmed\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imV3pPIUy1k\n\nWhat
    Rushkoff has done is acknowledge what Marshall McLuhan figured out decades ago,
    that technology extends the human nervous system.  That has implications, big
    implications and as such these are implications which won't be solved by shared
    understanding but through personal reflection - because a life is what each of
    us bring into the world - our own life.  I accept what Rushkoff is saying here
    as our individual base reality.  Where I see hope is in how I am trying to figure
    out intelligence rather than merely the program.\n\nThe only thing we as human
    beings have which is capable of being more than the biological program that we
    enter the world with, is our given ability to transcend the program.  That is
    why I like the approach of Jiddu Krishnamurti when he stated that \"truth is a
    pathless land\", and yet he was still followed, his life still became the very
    thing he advocated against, to think these things through oneself rather than
    rinse, repeat and rinse again what someone else has written or thought.\n\nThe
    difference between a program and intelligence is in the personal transformation
    or transcendence.  That is why I think that the human condition (the program)
    loves triangles or what we call hierarchies and circles or what we call tribes. 
    The emergence of intelligence in that regard is not an intellectual or an emotional
    centered event, it is emergent, it is self-organizing and that is why I think
    some folks in complexity science are interesting, in that there starting point
    is chaos and not simply order that is a part of our condition (e.g. the human
    mind seeks order). \n\nThe conception of freedom was never meant to be an easy,
    but freedom involves transcending the human condition and try to get to the other
    side of that condition, which is \"an intelligence\".  We have programmed the
    word \"intelligence\" also or we have done much worse and applied symbols of idolatry
    to it, which only serve to lose the wisdom of how we mature or develop our own
    individual intelligence.\n\nYesterday I wrote two blobs of thoughts.  One was
    deleted (a blog owners right) maybe because it did not fit the program, but the
    other was accepted (yet both  were a spray and pray approach - the way I usually
    engage them).   The person who accepted my thought experiment was Edward Carr,
    and here I was thinking over the language we use to describe \"poverty\" :\n\n\"The
    Joy of Not Having\" comment - written through the compass direction of \"Emeri
    Gent\"\nhttp://www.edwardrcarr.com/opentheechochamber/?p=342#comment-1923\n\nWhat
    Douglas Rushkoff cannot show me is the underlying nature or truth of my own programming. 
    The key to unlocking that is \"Freedom\" and more importantly action which gives
    rise to an awareness, that emerges into an intelligent being is how I pursue my
    own victory (to know thyself).  My programming is stupefying as the next mortal
    fellow but I engage my freedom to be, not my freedom to have.  I can't rewrite
    the code of life, I can only transform it into this thing we refer to as \"life\".\n\nAs
    I read Albert Camus, I saw how he saw within the human condition a freedom for
    crime - his book \"The Rebel\" serves now as another reference point in my own
    life journey, and that is where the word Freedom really is key.  Intelligence
    turns freedom into a virtue but our programming can turn freedom into a crime,
    the form of crime that Albert Camus is far better at explaining than I.  \n\nAt
    the end of the day Martin Luther King Jr. personified freedom as a virtue through
    his words \"Let Freedom Reign\".\n\n[Em]\n"

     Blogging platform? I hope not, more just doing what I have always been doing for a decade and more, until that is personal branding came along in the year 2000 and social media experts appeared with a suitcase and a song, and so of course, Jim Morrison said it best :

    I was doing time
    In the universal mind,
    I was feeling fine.
    I was turning keys,
    I was setting people free,
    I was doing alright.

    Then you came along,
    With a suitcase and a song,
    Turned my head around.
    Now I'm so alone,
    Just looking for a home
    In every place I see.

    I'm the freedom man.
    Yeah, that's how lucky I am.
    I'm the freedom man.

    from the Universal Mind by The Doors

    Blogging assumes something I definitely not am, a point view going out into the world - I simply am doing time in the universal mind, with a penchant to explore in four directions.   Two other songs sum it up also :

    Johnny Cash - Four Strong Winds

    Bob Seger - Roll Me Away

  content: " Of course blogging at its best is a form of exploration.  I merely consider
    for my own particular pathway that blogging is a form of centralized exploration. 
    Decentralized exploration does not come at the expense of centralized exploration,
    just as the decentralized social web is an idea that has its own merits compared
    to a centralized social web.  \n\nThe word \"diaspora\" is pretty meaningful in
    this context.  Exploration without a home, without a label is solely my own perspective. 
    What is important isn't the boundary or the unbound but my role as a nomadic guest,
    traveling via your home.\n\nI must always respect the home called victus spiritus
    but that merely changes the appreciation or lens of our exploration.  It is still
    exploration whether it is inside-out or outside in.  We should not live in a world
    that is Facebook type vs. Diaspora type of social web, but one which we appreciate
    the relationship between centralized exploration AND decentralized exploration.\n\nRegards\n[Em]"

    we change. A gravity well orbiting a sun and revolving is an appropriate analogy.
    \r\n\r\nI should point out that centrality of location on the web is defined by
    consistency more than url, and there is great consistency in the persona Em http://disqus.com/emerigent/,

<p>It is a state of mind and being. Like energy it is neither created nor destroyed, instead it moves from one life to another. A prisoner can live free and a world leader can be trapped by circumstance. Freedom cannot be granted, it cannot be purchased, nor can it be exchanged, it must be realized and practiced.</p>
<p>Freedom is the motivation and ability to choose a path in a world of opportunity. Freedom is not tangled in the web of fears of our forefathers, it is ours to experience and reinvent today. Your fiscal debt and bank account may restrict your actions and affect your circumstances, but neither impacts your liberty. <i>Never mind the money</I>.</p>
<h1>Cash and Choice</h1>
<p>At the beginning of May I revisited the <a href="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2011/05/01/oasis-surviving-the-desert-of-the-real/">relationship between capital and freedom</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>
A moment of contemplation makes vividly clear the distinction between the pursuit of wealth, and directly nourishing that which we need, liberty
</p></blockquote>
<p>What I discovered while writing the oasis is that our society is incapable of granting freedom through wealth transfer. Freedom is not something communities are capable of redistributing to individuals. We must discover personal liberty independent of social income, only then may we live free as a society. </p>
<h1>Frantically pursuing wealth without experiencing freedom, is a reinforcing social sickness</h1>
<p>When we make the mistake of equating money with freedom, we propagate a lie that persists for generations. One does not imply or even correlate to the other beyond a minimal level of sustenance (ie abject poverty inhibits freedom). Ownership of vast fortunes and freedom are orthogonal states of existence, even though I have long mistaken one for the other.</p>
