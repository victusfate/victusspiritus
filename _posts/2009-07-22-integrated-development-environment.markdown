  content: Sorry but this is apples to oranges comparison. In the same way you can
    complain about VS2008 being unprepared for PHP. It&#39;s not mainstream use of
    that IDE. VS2008 is good for C#/VB.NET. Eclipse is even better for it&#39;s main
    language - Java. Why? compare refactoring tools, simple find class-by-name. Obviously
    you can get those features by installing resharper (for extra $$$).

    (1) call hierarchy<br> (2) proper incremental builds of projects<br> (3) speed,
    speed, speed (scaling to large 1000LKOC projects)

  content: No qualms about your argument they are different things, but think about
    it from a setup standpoint (that&#39;s where I&#39;m coming from). <br><br>There&#39;s
    definitely a gap between the installation of Netbeans/Eclipse and having a functional
    environment for integrated web programming. I&#39;d love to see developers address
    that gap to make the ease of entry into IDE web programming smoother. I know many
    devs don&#39;t want to be restricted by an IDE, and generic build/make like files
    exported from an IDE allow for that.

    and post is more focused on setting up the environment (more than working in the
    environment).

  content: Have you ever tried IntelliJ IDEA? No C++/C support however, which might
    be a drawback for you, but for web-development, and JVM-based languages it&#39;s
    the thing you might find really great. Just give it try. There is one month free
    evaluation available that would give you the feeling.

    we don&#39;t know about (I&#39;ve heard of IntelliJ but hadn&#39;t tried it yet).
    Serendipity and great suggestions from friendly folks that don&#39;t mind sharing.<br>Thanks

<p>I've spent the past few nights struggling with learning the new friendfeed API v2. I very much enjoy the functionality and experience of using friendfeed and would greatly benefit from applying their authorization, social, and feed grabbing functions into a project I'm currently working. The folks at friendfeed have been very helpful (just found out the version of python I installed is too new) by giving pointers on setting up their sample project, which shows the API in action. Unfortunately none of them use IDEs internally and I think I'm starting to understand why. It's a serious ball buster trying to get the IDEs to work properly with the languages and software they use.</p>
<h2>Mr. IDE builders, might I humbly request...</h2>
<p>A simple to download and install IDE for web apps (have it automatically set the path and any needed libs with a single click install).</p>
<p>The state of setting up IDEs for web applications is a mess, and there's a great need for having a consistent, easy to install environment for building in all the web <a class="zem_slink" title="Programming language" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">programming languages</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>java</li>
<li>java ee</li>
<li>php</li>
<li>scala (+lift)</li>
<li>python</li>
<li>ruby (+ on rails)</li>
<li>Google Application Engine</li>
<li>C++/C#</li>
<li>Groovy</li>
<li>Haskell (thanks to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/gnuvince">gnuvince</a> for catching my mind mangling of pascal and Haskell)</li>
</ul>
<p>Why the added friction to entry?</p>
