  content: Wow Laurent, you&#39;re batch processing posts today. Glad to see you enjoying
    a few of my thought riffs and finds. <br><br>I&#39;m still amazed at how little
    information our minds need to update knowledge of our surroundings. If only web
    updates could be so efficient to our state of knowledge.

  content: The fact that we forget might be where it&#39;s at. Forgetting and succinctly
    storing what we learn/do/share/make gives us in my opinion the ability to get
    more of these updates.<br><br>Web updates come in roughly and there is a double
    process of selection to make.<br><br>#on thought riffs and finds :<br>It seems
    we have both relevant content to share to each other, some that I can&#39;t unfortunately
    share with my close friend because of their interests. (always tried to get my
    friends to visit stuckincustoms lol :-D, you do, saves me time) <br>Then again,
    having irrelevant content is also a good way to keep in touch and actually be
    aware of those surroundings...

  content: I&#39;m a huge fan of Trey Ratcliff (admit to not picking up the book yet,
    will remedy that asap). I fire a storm of links to his photo-blog whenever I can.
    Not only his perspective but his way of uplifting other photographers and going
    on photowalks has earned my trust/admiration.<br><br>I keep joking that my fianc√©
    Michelle and I would love to be his pack handlers on one of his excursions...

  content: 'This isn&#39;t a doozy of a post, your words. It is an easy read and accessible
    without getting highly technical in any single area. A few thoughts an questions
    I now have, hope you&#39;ll reply despite 4  mths since post date!<br><br>There
    are 4 interfaces.  each with significant "packet dropping": <br>1. Light enters
    the  eye at lens and pupil, passes through vitreous humor, travels diameter of
    eye and transitions to<br>2) Retina which processes then sends input  to<br>3)
    optical nerve to<br>4) visual cortex to<br>5) specific physical area in brain
    where visual signals are merged with other senses to give composite perception
    of world around us.<br> <br>I was aware of the power of our retinas, but didn&#39;t
    realize how little information passes on to the visual cortex and brain. Yet it
    must be sufficient, else human image perception and synthesis would not be what
    it is.  So how do we manage, with such "lossy" data feeds? You suggest massively
    parallel pattern matching, running dynamically. Sounds possible.  And if only
    10% of visual cortex synapses handles  incoming data, then the other 90% is processing
    and evaluating and synthesizing dynamic input AND storing as well.  So here&#39;s
    my question, is it possible that the already established synapse connections work
    like cache or "temporary files" further speeding up visual perception?  <br>(Sorry
    for long post)'

  content: Don&#39;t be sorry for the comment, many folks have left far longer and
    I always appreciate well thought ideas.<br><br>Yes, I think our visual processing
    center is quite capable of caching non-changing information in the short term
    but I don&#39;t have any further information beyond that (my neuro-biology background
    is light, only a single introductory college course).

<h2>A Curious Coincidence: Photons, Neural Compression, and Perception</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.stuckincustoms.com/2010/03/10/fairy-tale-bridge/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3247" title="Tolkienesque Bridge" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2010/03/Tolkienesque-Bridge.jpg" alt="" height="422px" width="600px" /></a></p>
<p>Long have I wondered how our minds  perform the enormous processing task of transforming incident light into a 3 dimensional reality, while triggering memory and understanding. After a great deal of reading and many years working on sensor simulations I have only a laymen's understanding of the process. Join me in a journey that crosses thousands of light years to illuminate the magic of our minds. </p>
<h2>Photons from Distant Galaxies Become Information to Our Minds</h2>
<p><a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disc"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2010/03/l_750_600_22EFE275-217B-47B1-A23D-88B0CCF0D0FE.jpeg" alt="" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>
<p>Let's begin by tracing photons from a distant <a HREF="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar?wasRedirected=true">quasar*</a> at the edge of the universe all the way to a human observer looking at telescope data. The photons first leave their energetic home and traverse space and time over billions of years. Their course may bend many times as the photons near other galaxies and eventually pass close to our own sun and encounter an enormous aperture. Let's gloss over the complex signal processing that transforms data and imagery, and instead follow the newly made light from a human readable display. The light finds it's way to curious human eyes. For the next step in the information chain, I'll borrow from an <a HREF="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2009/10/23/genuine-posts-are-images-of-our-minds/">earlier post on digital and optical Images</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Our optical system quantizes measured photons in a similar manner to a digital focal plane. While rods give us black and white vision in low light conditions, our cones spatial orientation uniquely captures incident photons. While the majority are sensitive to red light (64%), some to green (32%), and only a tiny minority to blue light (2%). The proteins in the cones help trigger a nerve response which is channeled down the optical nerves to the part of brains that transforms these signals into three dimensional representations of our surroundings.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Local light that comes from sources closer to home, like this blog post or your display, are raw data that your senses use to compose a conscious image of your surroundings. But how do these incident photons become a human concept? One vital piece of the puzzle is massive data compression.</p>
<h2>Biological Optical Data Compression</h2>
<p><I>The investigators calculate that <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news73156830.html">the human retina can transmit data at roughly 10 million bits per second.</a></I>. That data rate matches the older Ethernet cable speed of 10mbits/second.<br />
What data rate is available at the visual cortex?<br />
<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=does-dark-energy-exist">article in scientific american (behind a paywall)</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
Visual information, for instance, degrades significantly as it passes from the eye to the visual cortex.</p>
<p>Of the virtually unlimited information available in the world around us, the equivalent of 10 billion bits per second arrives on the retina at the back of the eye. Because the optic nerve attached to the retina has only a million output connections, just six million bits per second can leave the retina, and only 10,000 bits per second make it to the visual cortex.<br />
After further processing, visual information feeds into the brain regions responsible for forming our conscious perception. </p>
<p>Surprisingly, the amount of information constituting that conscious perception is less than 100 bits per second. Such a thin stream of data probably could not produce a perception if that were all the brain took into account; the intrinsic activity must playa role.</p>
<p>Yet another indication of the brain's intrinsic processing power comes from counting the number of synapses, the contact points between neurons. In the visual cortex, the number of synapses devoted to incoming visual information is less than 10 percent of those present. Thus, the vast majority must represent internal connections among neurons in that brain region.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So our optical process distills billions of potential bits of light into 100bits per second. Although the compression is lossy, it's good enough for us to interact with our surroundings and respond to motion rapidly (reflexes & frontal cortex). My hypothesis is that our mind continually estimates our surroundings and updates that state with a miniscule fraction of the raw input data (the ultimate change detection). I can only guess that massively parallel pattern matching is taking place to compress vital data differences at each moment. This compressed collection of neural signals updates our perception of reality. We continually track and estimate the world around us.</p>
<p>Notes:<br />
*Quasar: <i>there is now a scientific consensus that a quasar is a compact region in the centre of a massive galaxy surrounding the central supermassive black hole</I>. (from wikipedia link at the start of the post)</p>
<p>^Visualization of data: Purely visual representation of distant solar bodies has been a challenge to artists and masters of scale (exaggerating structures for display), and this is how the non-experts experience the data</p>
