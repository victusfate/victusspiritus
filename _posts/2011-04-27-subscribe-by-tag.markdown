<p>This post is for folks who are interested in subscribing to a subset of updates on wordpress blogs. For instance you could skip my non coding posts, or vice versa. Just subscribe to a tag or topic you enjoy like:</p>
<pre>
<a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/tag/inspiration/feed">http://www.victusspiritus.com/tag/inspiration/feed</a> 
or in general
http://www.victusspiritus.com/tag/(tag_name)/feed
</pre>
<p>Where (tag_name) is any tag which has been attached to a post. Then choose subscribe by email, google reader or your favorite feed reader. Feed Readers for those unfamiliar with the tool, is like a web newspaper of your favorite topics, and works splendidly with well designed apps like Feedly or Flipboard (iPad).</p>
<p>Here's the mother load of tags I've assigned to posts in the past:<br />
<a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/tag-cloud/">http://www.victusspiritus.com/tag-cloud/</a></p>
<p>Note that if a blog author is using feedburner they'll have to enable subscribing by tag, otherwise those feeds are subsumed by the primary blog feed: http://domain.com/feed</p>
