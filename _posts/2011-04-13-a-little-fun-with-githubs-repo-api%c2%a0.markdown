<p>This morning I'm away on a rough sea voyage<sup><a href="#notes">1</a></sup> so the post will be short and sweet. Last night I finally found a few moments to setup a default landing page at <a href="http://victusfate.github.com">victusfate.github.com</a>. I had procrastinated building a github landing page because I had an idea of what I wanted, but wasn't sure how to begin. It turns out the github repo API is easy to use, and a jQuery getJSON call later I was parsing my repos. The example linked to above is embedded below.</p>
