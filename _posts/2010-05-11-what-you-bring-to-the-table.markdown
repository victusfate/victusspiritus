  content: I fit into your shoes. I&#39;m not a web designer, but I&#39;m not too
    bad at building web applications. My typical weapons of choice are usually Rails
    on the backend paired with GWT. Have you considered using GWT or Cappuccino? For
    guys like us, these frameworks are a godsend.<br><br>-JP

  content: I have Cappuccino bookmarked, but haven&#39;t read much about the google
    web toolkit. I&#39;ll add it to the short list of stuff to read over (after Padrino).
    Thanks for the heads up JP!<br><br>I&#39;m pretty far from a "designer" but I
    need to be able to get things good enough for user review.

  content: Mark, great post and I am always happy when someone gets me thinking about
    founding a startup!<br><br>I want to break down my response to your ideas in sections:<br><br>"This
    isn’t BigCo where somebody else worries about something getting done. You have
    to get your hands dirty repeatedly if you’re going to get anywhere. "<br><br>This
    might be one of the most important sentences for anyone considering founding a
    startup to read. If you are not willing to get down and dirty with the code or
    manual labor, don&#39;t even think about founding a startup. It just is NOT going
    to happen. Leaders lead from the front.<br><br>The only situation in which I could
    fathom a tech company founder not doing the coding himself is if he brings an
    exceptional amount of money and/or connections to the table. In that case, a co-founder
    based on a strong technical background combined with a founder with great industry
    connections and financial backing could work.<br><br>From what you were saying
    Mark, the bottom line, founding a startup means being in the trenches from day
    one.<br><br>I was in a similar situation a year ago, but thankfully, I was joining
    a startup as a first employee, not a founder. Since then I have done everything
    from after effects to photoshop, AI scripting to PHP tracking, and even a bit
    of javascript and actionscript 3. Frankly I don&#39;t even know what to put on
    my business card. The jack of all trades master of none phrase works well in a
    startup. You can master something later on, but in the early stages, be a jack.<br><br>And
    something that made a huge impression in my mind - "(be) hungry^, ambitious, and
    relentless" .<br><br>I couldn&#39;t agree more... when it comes down to it, the
    dedication and hard work that you and your team puts out will make or break the
    startup, not their experience or technical background (well you need *some* technical
    background.. but it&#39;s not important:). Finding people that believe in the
    idea and vision is more important then anything else.<br><br>Thought i&#39;m sure
    my ideas in this comment have already been mentioned many times across the web...
    never helps to reinforce them every so often. :)

  content: Your repeated comments are appreciated Leland. You&#39;re one startup ahead
    of me so your experiences are a great value add to my instincts, riffs, and discoveries.
    Thanks for taking the time to contribute. Please don&#39;t hesitate to hit me
    up if I can ever be of assistance in your founders quest.

<p><a HREF="http://www.metamorphblog.com/2010/05/founders-without-hackers.html">Matt Mireles</a> called out a growing disparity between non-tech and technical cofounders in the NYC startup scene. I was in this situation last year where I had an idea for a product, but had no idea how, where, or who could begin making it. Before I describe my experiences after the last few months, I'd like to take a hard look at the value of founders in a startup.</p>
<h2>Lessons Learned Last Year</h2>
<p>Ideas are cheap, and don't survive unchanged once they go live in a product. I knew this, but hadn't experienced how true this was until my first idea flopped. As a cofounder of an early tech company you bring a mix of these primary resources: money, connections, or hacking skills to the table. You would be wise to continually refine these skill areas. If your company has funding, and is well connected there's no reason why you can't help out with other needed areas even if you don't usually code, or do marketing, or financial projections. This isn't BigCo where somebody else worries about something getting done. You have to get your hands dirty repeatedly if you're going to get anywhere. </p>
<p>Take the plunge and start wrestling with basic design using HTML, CSS, or Javascript. Of course contribute in your areas of expertise first, we're all chief of something in a startup, but if your primary skills aren't needed that moment, do whatever you possibly can to improve your startups chances of success. Does the marketing lead (that's everyone in a startup) need a helpful henchman to change every browser in Best Buy to your company site? Go do it. The clock's ticking, and you don't want to be the person who <a HREF="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/05/budgeting-in-a-small-early-stage-company.html#comment-49325088">drops the pappy</a>.</p>
<h2>Back to how Idea #1 Developed into #2 & 3</h2>
<p>So I blogged about my idea, talked the idea up on friendfeed, twitter, comment sections everywhere and a few times on AVC's comment section. I bumped into savy business centric non-technical cofounders. We still couldn't build anything. Thanks Vlad for your input then.</p>
<p>I met with other startups that were adept with the technology I wanted to work with, and they said it was possible. Thanks Bostjan & Andraz from <a href="http://zemanta.com">Zemanta</a>. I still couldn't build anything useful.</p>
<p>I talked to sharp investors and other founders and they said before you have a chance at seed funding you need a product and a user base. No product. No user base. </p>
<p>I decided learning web developmet was the only way I was going to get anywhere. I have a background in algorithm development and c++ but knew Zero about web dev. Seriously I was lost without my Windows Visual Studio IDE, or how to read or write data on the web or the nature of RESTful APIs. I might have been better off knowing nothing to start out, but with a bit of luck, and a liberal amount of cursing I had a shakey <a href="http://victusmedia.com/old_site">wireframe php example</a>. </p>
<p>While still pitching the user focused ad tool to everyone I met online and on the street, I bumped into a guy on Google Wave, yeah that <i>thing</I>. After a 3 hour wave chat, a week of hacking and a flood of email I knew I had found someone my kind of crazy. Not long after Tyler had me learning the basics of Ruby on Rails as he lead the charge for the alpha.</p>
<p>Fast forward 7 months of night time hacking and a few major product pivots. I'm comfortable with simple web programming in a variety of languages although JavaScript and Ruby are my current preferences. I'm pretty stoked at working with a different database layer that let's me define the schema within models (<a href="http://www.padrinorb.com/">Padrino</a>). </p>
<p>Tyler's skills have grown vastly while we've worked together. I'm always learning from the Chief Hacknical Wizard at <a href="http://victusmedia.com">Victus Media</a>. It's important from a product design standpoint to know what can be done rapidly. I'm the first to admit I can't keep up with all the new languages, frameworks, standards, and obscure protocols he wields like a Jedi*.  This forces me to always question what I bring to the table, and that's a good state of mind to be in: hungry^, ambitious, and relentless</p>
<p>Notes:<br />
*=Tyler's brain hasn't been rotted like mine by over 14 years of simulations and algorithm minutiae. If you need to apply quaternions to optimally calculate super positions of protein molecules, simulate sensor systems, or perform detection and tracking on a deluge of data though I'm your guy. </p>
<p>^= fat guys are always hungry </p>
