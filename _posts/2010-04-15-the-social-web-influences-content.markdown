  content: Where do you find the blogs you comment on? And the new bloggers? I need
    to do more commenting on others&#39; blogs. There&#39;s a big Internet out there
    and I end up going to the same half dozen sites over and over. <br><br>That chicken
    video is crazy. I have to have some coffee before I finish watching it.

  content: I found most of the blogs I frequent through iterative social  <br>searching.
    Check out <a HREF="http://disqus.com/VictusFate/" rel="nofollow">http://disqus.com/VictusFate/
    <br></a> for some of them. Unfortunately many of the comments I leave are  <br>on
    non-disqus blogs so there&#39;s no easy collection of them.<br><br>By the way
    Dave, as much as I love commenting, I&#39;m not rich or famous  <br>because of
    it. I just really appreciate it when people pipe up on my  <br>blog like yourself
    :)<br><br>Speaking of which, anything new I should check out on your blog?  <br>(sometimes
    I miss your tweets and rarely check my rss reader).<br><br>Nevermind just caught
    it and retweeted , will send fuel your way asap!

  content: There&#39;s a psychic reward in seeing comments. I like seeing them too.
    <br><br>Thanks for that retweet, btw. Been posting more frequently the last couple
    of days, since I decided to just post on one blog instead of two.

    you use them) so I don&#39;t miss your posts. You are afterall my most  <br>consistent
    commenter!

  content: Hmm, wasn&#39;t praising them exactly. I did get traffic from Twitter,
    but  <br>mostly on topics that talk about Twitter. It&#39;s the Pikachu concept,  <br>the
    most common words on Twitter are Twitter, tweet, social media and  <br>most readers
    from Twitter are familiar with social media sharing.<br><br>I think I have a way
    for my Identi.ca, Buzz, or Redrob.in posts to get  <br>pushed to Twitter. I&#39;m
    satisfied as long as the media can exist  <br>outside the central server. Still
    weird how we only have limited  <br>access to our own and friends data through
    Twitter.<br><br>One way of fully opening up, Pubsubhubbub looks like it is being  <br>rejected
    by Twitter API folks. Probably due to short sighted ideas  <br>about information
    control. They&#39;d have a much larger audence instantly  <br>if they embraced
    current web real time distribution channels.<br><br>Appreciate the comment though,
    it&#39;s good to get an outside perspective  <br>on my varying hypocrisy levels
    :)

    Â I've started to play around with William Mougayar curation portal Eqentia. While still early its a powerful discovery tool with some possibilities.

<h2>The Gravity of Social Topics</h2>
<p>Like many "new bloggers"* I receive a majority of visitors from social web locations. Social sharing sites like Twitter, HackerNews, and comments^ are my dominant referral sites, comprising a large fraction of this blogs monthly traffic. What this means is that 80-90% of readers here are familiar with social media and feel comfortable sharing these posts with their friends and commenting (engagement/resonance). This causes social web topics to dominate in page views and virality (retweets, likes) not just for Victus Spiritus, but for many new bloggers. Social web users (the social web is read/write) are self selecting content that falls into known categories and grooves that are familiar. </p>
<p>The most common talked about topic on Twitter is Twitter. It's like the Pikachu characters that screech their own name to self identify (and nothing else). The other dominant topics are celebrities, major events, and daily habits. At some point social media networks grow up, as user bases stabilize and either enable connectivity on varied interests or die out. The Ouroborus can grow only so large by eating it's own tail. </p>
<p>But within networks that survive maturation is where the magic happens. This rich topical engagement is already brewing within Twitter and Facebook to varying degrees, you just need to spend some time looking for the right communities. The social web is an incredible source of serendipitous search. Just from my daily visits to <a href="http://www.avc.com/">AVC (Fred Wilson's blog)</a> I generally pick up a few links to well matched sources of information or new tools. Whether it's a new startup or an excellent media juggling tool, I'm rarely dissappointed. Each tool has a founder's story behind it, making it much more compelling. The struggle to independently create valuable tools resonates with my own creative urges.</p>
<h2>Content Influences the Social Web</h2>
<p>Addictive hit songs and movies or video series can instantly spread throughout the web to niche communities. The long tails of human interest gravitate towards the highest quality or most interesting media, which flows back to larger but broader attention groups.</p>
<p>A great blog post or interview can spin off many thousands of side discussions to dissect every nuance of a topic. It is through our collective and critical examination that we discover truth.</p>
<p>Games are something to talk about, and share experiences within so they are an incredibly popular and successful extension of social media. Folks can bond over the latest hit social game and discuss strategies or multiplayer experiences. Game behavior can also improve the quality and culture of virtual social locations. The future of web sites and mobile platforms are those that we bring with us. This blog travels 10-12 miles with me each morning as I write it while walking.</p>

<p>Notes:<br />
* I've blogged a little over a year and ~390 posts.</p>
<p>^ one of my "guerilla marketing" tactics to find my blog's community is to comment on related blog posts I'm interested in a few thousand times a year. I have a dozen or two favorite blogs I frequent but make sure to visit and say hello to a few new bloggers a week</p>
