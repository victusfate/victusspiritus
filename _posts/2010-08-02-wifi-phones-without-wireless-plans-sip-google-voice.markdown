  content: I have it nearly working. <br><br>I receive incoming calls to Gizmo5 fine
    and you can use other SIP providers, I also have Nimbuzz on my "phone".<br><br>But
    for outgoing calls I can&#39;t seem to get it to use Google Voice. GVoice tries
    to use the phones native dialer and it fails. If I dial out with Gimzo5 it looks
    like an 800 number when my friends get the call.

  content: Mark this is pure awesome and I think we are just on the cusp of being
    able to free ourselves almost completely from the service providers.<br><br>Is
    the portable mifi/wifi bulky and/or expensive? I have never had any experience
    with those. <br><br>For a home phone line, I can see a skype/google voice phone
    completely taking over. But for the pure mobility that a cell phone should offer,
    isn&#39;t there no other way then to sign on with one of the mobile carriers?
    I didn&#39;t really understand very well how you are going to get connectivity
    when you are not near a wifi spot.<br><br>:)

<p>It all started this weekend when my two week old Droid X had a camera malfunction. It showed no input, no matter what me or the helpful Verizon tech guy did. All we got was a blank image with the heads up display working fine. As they didn't have a replacement or a close alternative (HTC Incredible) I returned the phone. If the hardware flaked this early I was worried what would happen later.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Problem 1) This left me for the first time in ~10 years without a cell phone number which was currently my only phone line</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Problem 2) As a guy who blogs daily by smart phone and consumes a few hundred megabytes of wireless browsing each month, I became a little concerned (picture a large bead of sweat forming on my brow).</p>
<h2>Being the Right Kind of Crazy</h2>
<p>At this point I could have punted and picked up another phone or plan. My immediate options were an old Verizon phone (no) or going to the Apple store and dropping $300-600 (locked-unlocked) on an iPhone 4 and tie myself into another contract. Either way I wasn't thrilled about another year or two of AT&amp;T wireless prison - dropped calls, crappy reception, overpriced bits.</p>
<p>I turned to the fount of wisdom for all things tech, the Internet, to dig up how to setup a wifi phone account with a Google Voice number and a dream. Google Voice requires a US number and one of the services that works well with it is Gizmo5. Unfortunately Gizmo is no longer accepting sign ups after Google's acquisition. Lucky for me, I just happened to have an old account*. But there's one more catch, a hurdle I'm more than ready to jump to make this work. Google Voice now requires at least one "physical" line.</p>
<h2>Virtual Physical Lines</h2>
<p>This is where things became a bit tricky and it took clever phone hackers to bypass the barrier.  I'll need to setup a free/cheap SIP number this week in addition to Gizmo5 to satisfy the requirement of a US phone number for Google Voice. With this final piece of the puzzle I'll have a phone number with free calls in the US and a few cents for international calls. If full mobility is needed, I can pickup a portable mifi/wifi data node (Sprint/Verizon/etc). If I can make this work (almost there) and then refine it into a smoother one click process, it may force the separation and dumbing down of wireless pipes. <strong>To hell with bit discrimination.</strong></p>
<h2>Save Money Every Month</h2>
<p>Right now using this means saving money. It'll be a much cheaper wireless bill at $50ish bucks instead of $85-120 dollars. That's a savings of $35-70 dollars every month. With market forces driving the cheapest bit as opposed to "bullshit bundles" we can expect the price per bit to drop rapidly to a commoditized level. Most of us want tasty cheap bits.</p>
<p>Lessons learned: (<em>tip of the hat to <a href="http://www.steveblank.com">Steve Blank</a>)<a href="http://www.steveblank.com"><br />
</a></em></p>
<ul>
<li>*= sign up for anything that sounds like a good tool. You never know when Google may buy it and lock you out</li>
<li>Charging more for bits of a certain colored packet is data discrimination. Businesses that rely on this are begging to be disrupted</li>
<li>Smart folks in this area have been struggling on a different front by pushing open spectrum to open up the airwaves to dynamic structured connectivity like wifi. Explore <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/tag/open-spectrum">open spectrum</a> for more background info</li>
