<p><i>A different kind of resume</I></p>
<p>I spent time this weekend taking an ancient resume in an aging doc format and making it into something which better represents my current interests and pursuits. I received some excellent feedback on design tips and signaling issues not long after I posted my <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/resume/marks_resume.html">current resume</a> and the <a href="http://github.com/victusfate/html5-resume">supporting source</a> on github. </p>
<p><I>Signaling Efficacy and Target Audience</I></p>
<p>I'll first address any signaling confusion  brought up in reaction to posting the resume. Make no mistake, I want nothing more professionally than to breathe life into a new business, as it feeds into building a job I love. Many investors may want to know more about my background after a pitch, and this html5 "slide deck" fills that need. Besides having a URL as a business card feels more appropriate to the professional and cultural group I wish to work with. </p>
<p>In addition I'm certainly not above taking other gigs to survive while working on Victus Media's latest project. It doesn't benefit myself or the business to be in a position of desperation while negotiating with investors. They don't care how needy I am. Product and pitch are all that matters. I've been reminded time and again that when our product is ready and the market is proven, investors will seek us out.</p>
<p><I>Design suggestions from friends</I></p>
<p>There's an issue where one page is long enough to require a scroll button, which  also grabs the mouse wheel up/down events. I spent time reorganizing and shuffling information, and debated disconnecting the mouse wheel from page navigation but settled on the current version. Using mousewheel down to read on, is a habit I couldn't ignore.</p>
<p>If you see the resume load, you'll notice the bullets slowly appear over a few seconds. That's something most HR folks or Job Placement teams will loathe and lead to them skipping over the document. That flow is completely intentional. As I mentioned earlier, this document is designed for a specific professional and cultural group. If your job is to read hundreds of resumes a day, you're not the audience I want reading it. The mantra of CouchDB sits very well with the theme of this fade in design, <I>relax.</I></p>
<p>Being calm and focused is far more conducive to productivity, than being frantic and buried in busy work.</p>
