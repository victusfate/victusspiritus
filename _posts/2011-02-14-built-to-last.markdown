<p>In it's earliest stage, a project is most malleable. Spinning pottery clay is still soft, concrete has yet to set, and experimental code is quick to build and <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2010/01/19/marvelous-throwaway-code-is-mind-candy/">throw away</a>. The moment we make a decision about the form and function of a construct, we set our work unerringly down a transformational path from abstract to concrete. We can't possibly predict all the avenues our crafts will make possible, or all the lives they will touch. If your work is important, you should build it to last.</p>
