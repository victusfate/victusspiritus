  content: Hi Mark,<br><br>Thanks for the insightful post!  I think crowd-sourcing
    social enterprises will help everyone become a &#39;change-agent&#39; and bring
    social entrepreneurship into the mainstream.  A lot of people might not be able
    to commit to a FT career in social entrepreneurship; however, the crowd-sourced
    model will allow many people to contribute a little bit of their resources to
    the greater good.  <br><br>Cheers,<br>Erik

  content: You&#39;re very welcome Erik. Enabling interested parties to contribute
    on their own terms is what will drive it change forward. Many projects that were
    impossible for an individual are immenently doable by thousands of enthusiastic
    volunteers. The more diverse their other skills/professions the better!

<p style="text-align: center;">Thomas Jefferson an Agent of Change</p>
<p>Agents of change, social entrepreneurs, and there are other names that express a mindset that is open to large scale improvements within our social and financial structures. Dennis Stevenson does an excellent job of characterizing the concept in <a href="http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/original-thinking/what-is-a-change-agent-23764">What is a "Change Agent?"</a>.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-865"></a></p>
<p>How do we create a social framework for anyone interested in becoming an agent of change? It's self energizing to make a positive impact. To know that time and effort expended improves the quality of peoples lives, even just a little bit, is immensely satisfying.</p>
<p>It takes time to pursue a selfish (or unselfish) interest. How do people with many responsibilities manage to free up that time? Making breathing room for creative energies to discover the right challenge is the only way to make progress on developing a passion.</p>
<p>Agents of change will be implementing grand strategies and small scale "smarter" methods by utilizing the monumental information flowing into and through the internet. They'll leverage social interest, and crowd source solutions that will emerge from simple observations and choices. Imagine what is next in line for external applications using Internet system strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>open</li>
<li>crowdsourced</li>
<li>innovative</li>
<li>realtime</li>
</ul>
<p>Tim O'Reilly and John Battelle expertly cover these topics in a recent article <a href="http://www.web2summit.com/web2009/public/schedule/detail/10194">Web Squared: Web 2.0 Five Years On</a>.</p>
<p>Imagine yourself as an agent of change, what would you do?</p>
