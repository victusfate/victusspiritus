    I *love* video games (though I'm more into puzzle/adventure games and sports games)...but haven't really played them all that much in the past 10 years or so...primarily because if I'm doing 'screen time' these days, I want it to be building/coding...but also because for me, games were always more a social thing (and I no longer live around friends that would drop by to play a few quick games of Madden for example)...

    My kids are already completely addicted to video games though and so they offen ask me to play...and I do for a little bit (hard to turn down your kids!)...but I find the fact that it's in such limited spurts that it's actually very annoying (for the same reason you mentioned...not enough to get good, too much to have fun stumbling around).

    Anyway - feel for you here...but rest assured, you'll find other (very) interesting things to fill the void =D

  content: "That's exactly what I need to recreate, that void or pocket where other
    projects can take life. There needs to be an empty space or room for new projects
    to grow. \n\nGlad to hear another gamer chime in. I'm a junky for games of all
    kinds: board games, card games, tabletop RPGs, miniature games, pc/console games.
    Totally agree with the social aspect. We played a variety of FPS and sports games
    at my house when I rented out rooms to friends between 1998-2002 (Golden Eye for
    Nintendo, Madden and Halo for Xbox). I moved on to MMOs (Planetside, World of
    Warcraft, City of Heroes) as friends moved away and got married, then eventually
    hopped on for 3 month stints of WoW in 2004, 2006, and 2008 and late last year."

  content: "Yeah, I need more life force boosters instead of time sync black holes.
    What we choose to do matters. \n\nDoesn't look like Michelle and I will be able
    to afford SXSW and a another vaca in the same year, so we're not going to make
    it to Austin in march. Now I'm trying to figure out how to refund or resell the
    two tickets for her and I, and then pick a trip she can enjoy more.\n\nHope all
    is well in Oregon. Heard Max Ogden moved to SF, what company did he join?"

<p>World of Warcraft, for those not familiar with online gaming, is a huge and beautiful virtual roleplaying world. It's also a seductive time sync.</p>
<p>I was going to try moderately playing an hour or two a week but that's hardly an instance (5 man dungeon) or a few quests which would be frustrating. I forget how to play characters well, or where I leave off after a few day break. In addition I enjoy playing many different characters, and the system fluctuates leading to a soft minimum play time required per week, aka a second or third job.</p>
<p>I was using it as an excuse to procrastinate work related tasks which are much more important to my future - looking for web startup jobs, working on side projects, going to tech meetups, and learning/reading in my spare time. It's an enchanting and fun game but it's also a black hole of free time. Why struggle with problem X when I can bang out some xp or get sweet loot for a blood elf or bear.</p>
<p>My current subscription ends January 16th. I may hop on periodically to unload some wow gold to friends I'm still indebted to, but it's better for me not to have the easy option of playing when my professional future requires all the enthusiasm,  time and effort I can muster. </p>
<p>Farewell Azeroth, I hardly knew you.</p>
