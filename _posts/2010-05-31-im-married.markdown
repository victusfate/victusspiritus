  content: Congratulations, Mark. Enjoy your vacation and don&#39;t feel compelled
    to share every snapshot or observation online in real time. Life is what happens
    when you&#39;re not posting stuff on the Internets. <br><br>It is interesting
    though that you and Tyler have gotten so far along with Victus Media without having
    met in person first. Sounds very 37 Signals of you guys.

  content: Ah, Terrific & Congrats! I was at a recent wedding near Palo Alto. From
    one of the recitals:<br><br>Blessed are you who volunteer to be secretary and
    take good minutes; your words will become history, and your efforts will move
    steadily forward rather than running absent mindedly over thoroughly discussed
    ground.<br><br>Best to both of you,<br><br>_____________Ron

  content: Oh, Mark -- no wonder you cried.  Wonderful toast.  I must say that from
    the very beginning of reading your comments on the AVC blog, I knew you were part
    of a twosome.  You are a man in love.  I have a feeling that you are one of the
    fortunate (blessed) ones who will always be.<br><br>What an exquisite bride!

<p>I'm living proof that wonderful things can happen to quasi-good people (I have my moments). I was fortunate in that Michelle didn't come to her senses last minute ;). One of my common jokes is that she'll get fed up with my corny jokes and startup dreams and run off with her world travelling lover "Pedro". So far so good!</p>
<h2>Wedding Toast</h2>
<p>My brother Ron killed the delivery, people wept, myself included. The core of the toast he snagged online and customized the rest with input from my folks.</p>
<blockquote><p>
I am honored and pleased to say a few words on this very special day... the wedding of my brother Mark to Michelle.</p>
<p>Today's celebration is the result of what happens when a physics and engineering geek falls in love with a molecular biologist while watching Japanese Anime. I know because I was there!</p>
<p>The love and respect they have shown each other has strengthened over the non-spatial continuum in which events occur in apparently irreversible succession from the past through the future - you know, TIME.</p>
<p>Dale Carnegie once said, "Don't ask a man what is important to him. Watch how he spends his time." I've watched Mark spend his time and I can see what's most important to him... it's Michelle. Michelle has given Mark a new appreciation of love and life... I'm so happy to welcome my new sister into the family.</p>
<p>I ask that loving family members and good friends join with me in toasting Mark and Michelle as they begin their exciting life together as husband and wife -- wishing them laughter, health, peace and happiness along with all the best things life has to offer.
</p></blockquote>
<h2>Posting as I can while travelling</h2>
<p>10 days in Maui, and 3 in San Fran Bay Area (finally meeting my partner in Victus Media Tyler and his wife Heather). Will be posting while walking/waiting. I'll snap pics and share them on <a HREF="http://messel.tumblr.com">My tumblog</a>,  <a HREF="http://www.google.com/profiles/messel">Google Buzz</a>, and<br />
<a HREF="http://messel.posterous.com">Posterous</a> periodically.</p>
