  alt=\"Sustainable\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" /></a>\r\n\r\nDue in part to hasty deadlines
  as well as intellectual apathy we are often unaware of the ramifications of our
  actions. Capitalism has fueled disruption in the name of efficiency. Outsourcing
  work to lower cost alternatives is standard practice throughout many of our industries.\r\n\r\nAfter
  an enlightening conversation with a local construction worker I have come to understand
  there are deeper issues than cost savings when entire business sectors are locally
  disrupted. People require time and passion to become experts in their disciplines.
  As human beings we are likely to have strong social and financial ties to our homes.
  Consider for a moment the impact of choosing a remote company to handle a local
  construction job. In a tight economy many local workers are struggling to stay employed.
  They may have spent the majority of their lives supporting local businesses and
  infrastructure (higher property taxes for schools, higher cost of living). And this
  higher cost of living is built into their businesses bottom line."

  content: hey mark, <br><br>i agree with a lot of what you are saying. in fact one
    of the things i think is exciting about our current times is that we are reaching
    a point where technology can automate so much that we are free to be more creative
    and compassionate, while machines can do more and more of the tasks that don&#39;t
    require human creativity. i know in my business, we try to automate as much as
    we can -- but the one thing we still cannot automate is human creativity and compassion,
    which are becoming increasingly important in cultivating, in my opinion. as a
    result i think we&#39;ll see more and more businesses invest in developing the
    creative and compassionate capabilities of their workforce. <br><br>perhaps that&#39;s
    a bit too idealistic -- although i can&#39;t deny that that&#39;s my nature! :)

  content: Thanks for stopping in kidmercury, glad you enjoyed my 2cents on the merging
    of capitalism with compassion. Why limit ourselves to a future devoid of caring,
    relentlessly bent on optimization? As you stated creativity and compassion can&#39;t
    be automated and we both agree have great value within any organization. Our optimal
    socio-economic system will have to incorporate this value.

    trying to prevent our reality from becoming that of the movie "Brazil" - where
    automation and bureaucracy choke humanity.<br><br>I&#39;m hopeful that technology
    in the end might foster more compassion and creativity by truly removing the economic
    friction that causes local areas to shrivel.

  content: 'Begin Rant:<br><br>First, I must take issue with, "This may be achieved
    by evolving a socio-economic system that has deep enough vision to redeploy and
    protect our local community resources, it’s people."<br><br>I think the best way
    of viewing evolution is that it does not have a vision, deep or shallow. You don&#39;t
    really evolve things (except maybe computer programs), they do it on their own.
    All you can provide is environmental selection preferences. <br><br>Ok, now for
    outsourcing, what kind of thing are you suggesting? Tariff wars? Voluntary restriction
    of selection of services, which, by the way, can serve to stifle innovation (by
    artificially selecting local businesses, we can actually fight against a kind
    of social evolution of businesses). <br><br>The idea that we should promote local
    businesses because money is not the only cost or value involved in the transaction
    may be a worthy idea, and I can understand similar ideas at least, if not this
    particular one, but it is not out of compassion or mercy or whatever that we act.
    It is out of long term rational self-interest. <br><br>When I read something against
    outsourcing, I immediately think, "so these local humans deserve our consideration,
    but not those other guys across the sea?" and also, "I wonder how crappy American
    cars would be today if people had listened to the &#39;Buy American&#39; talk."<br><br>Don&#39;t
    get me wrong, I think local people do matter more, in a selfish way: we have more
    dealing with them, they effect us more, etc. But let&#39;s not think of this as
    compassion or mercy. Let&#39;s call it rational.'

  content: Ok, more calm response :) <br><br>I guess I had issues with some of the
    words used, rather than really agreeing or disagreeing with your post.<br><br>I
    think the issue is really a complex problem, morally. Looking at the long term,
    it&#39;s difficult to tell what the best methods are. Globalization can disrupt
    things a lot for locals in various areas, and I think we in the US are a bit insulated
    from the consequences of these radical changes. <br><br>I read horror stories
    of children working in sweat shops, producing our cheap goods, and I read horror
    stories of what happens to those children when the sweat shops close. Is globalization
    good in the long term? Who are the victims in the short term? If people around
    the world are viewed as the same, if travel and free trade roam free, will this
    ultimately lead to fairer conditions for all? And in the short term?<br><br>And
    how about our local conditions? To me, the idea of paying local people to do jobs
    at higher cost sounds similar to the argument against automation of those jobs.
    Either way, the job is done more (cash-wise) cheaply, and local people don&#39;t
    get paid to do those jobs. Otoh, we&#39;re not going to sit in the stone ages,
    so piss off, eh?<br><br>The nature of humans require that we use our minds to
    achieve prosperity. If your job becomes obsolete for whatever reasons, you have
    to expand beyond it. This has been the way throughout history, and those who try
    to stifle technology (including the logistical tech of transportation and finding
    cheaper labor) get lost. Only by embracing change can we hope to prosper.

And this higher cost of living is built into their businesses bottom line.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-874"></a></p>
<p>In fact by continually choosing lower cost remote services we are moving to an unsustainable local economy. Some have mentioned this concept extends to our national reliance on external but less expensive business. While in many cases I agree with choosing what's efficient, there have to be a balance on how much service and products are incoming versus outgoing. Without a counter force of exporting great value, any entity faces financial collapse.</p>
<p>My simple perspective is that of compassion. Disruptive agents interested in improving overall efficiency are required to perform due diligance impact studies on the effect large shifts will have on local economies. There needs to be community support for those who have had their livelihoods displaced. This support can come in many forms, education, training, and realigning of existing skill sets to more efficient local businesses.</p>
<p>We should take nature as an example to model our economic decisions upon. A harmony must be created, without a sustaining core value, we are doomed to annhilate local social structures and communities. This in turn effects the whole, eroding national financial/social strength and the larger global economy. While nature judges survival of the fittest, each species is an analog to a business sector. Less efficient or effective species die out, their biomass and energy is maintained in a sustained ecosystem. In a similar manner we should conserve our skilled workers, business leaders, and philanthropists. This may be achieved by evolving a socio-economic system that has deep enough vision to redeploy and protect our local community resources, it's people.</p>
<p>In closing, instead of viewing inefficient existing businesses as an impediment to productivity, let us plan to respect individual expertise by incorporating valuable human resources into sustainable redesigned economies.</p>
