<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Thanks to Trey Ratcliff and his post about <a href="http://www.stuckincustoms.com/2010/01/15/templestorm-and-the-stunning-results-from-the-hdr-workshop/">the first HDR workshop</a> he ran, for reminding me how powerful a community of dedicated folks can be.</em></p>
<h2>1+1 &gt; 2</h2>
<p>Two people working enthusiastically but separately can't compete with two people working collaboratively. At <a href="http://victusmedia.com">Victus Media</a>, my web programming knowledge is limited yet I'm able to support Tyler's hacking/tech lead by generating weak prototypes, simple script samples, and brainstorming applications. I have a clear idea of where I want the business to go (core social web/stream curation utilities), and a growing grasp of the architecture we are weaving to get there.</p>
<p>A weak collaborative team occurs when two folks of vastly different skills in the same area team up without clear leadership. The communication and direction costs reduce the incredible output of one super producer. But that mashup of skill is the exception rather than the rule. More than just the labor advantage of <a href="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2009/06/10/2-1/">two people working over one</a>, there is a measurable productivity boost. Now there is more than just one pair of eyes to decide what's valuable. An immediate external set of feedback is only an email or phone call away. When you hit a wall in design/development your partner can help scale it, dig under it, or guide you around it. A diversity in skill sets can drive a team to extraordinary success.</p>
<h2>The Network of a Team</h2>
<p>The network effects of a passionate team are vastly superior to an individual of similar influence. Now instead of one set of social links, you have many. Developing social and business relationships can take an enormous amount of time and energy for any project team. Customer service is often the defining factor of an early startup, and managing it can be a nightmare for a super small team. The rich customer and communication network that existing businesses have is their most valuable asset. As the early team extends from two to three and more, the network effects compound the efficacy of the information sharing and feedback.</p>
<p>As communication enhances between remote members, new business and non-profit teams will emerge from the evolving social grid. The passion to build value in a dynamic space, acts as a compass to find others who share that enthusiasm. The proof of this trend is evident in both business and non-profit sectors.</p>
