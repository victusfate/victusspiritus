  content: I may be a gnarly old pessimist but I don&#39;t believe the majority of
    government officials or generals truly feel the cost of each individual soldier&#39;s
    life. In my mind, they are only numbers to be expended in the defense of personal
    wealth or power structure.<br><br>I have an extremely negative view of the elite
    and government officials currently in office because of the revolving door that
    sees corporate america go back and forth with government america. Two presidents
    from the same family just goes to show how much support money can buy.<br><br>Democracy
    was founded to give the people the chance to fairly vote for the next candidate,
    but with all of this two party BS and the fact that you need millions of dollars
    just to put your face out to the country means that only the rich and powerful
    are able to have a go at being president. <br><br>I&#39;m waiting for the day
    that government provides fair and balanced reporting on candidates to the people,
    and when we have an internet based system that allows citizens to verify themselves
    and vote on actions that the president is taking. We have the technology for a
    direct voting system on the actions that our politicians take, so why haven&#39;t
    we created anything to allow citizens direct say on important topics AFTER the
    election?<br><br>Election fraud (saying one thing during the election and doing
    other things while hiding those other things up after the election) is so common
    that people just laugh when candidates, having become president, fail to live
    up to their campaign promises. And this doesn&#39;t have to be so. The only thing
    stopping it is the massive backlash that the elite and corporations would have
    knowing that they couldn&#39;t just pour money into lobbyists to get their way
    with government regulations.<br><br>It sickens me.

  content: I too look to the Net to compliment democracy. Disruptive startups aren&#39;t
    limited to merely fiscal policy. Social policies can come from citizens who are
    willing to act and work together. <br><br>The flash mobs of Foursquare show just
    one example of rallying people to a location. Twitter was used by both Chinese
    and Iranian citizens to connect with each other.

<em>crematorium markers at Calverton Cemetery</em></p>
<p>Tomorrow is flag day, which triggered thoughts of nationalism. I'm not a person easily bound to others by geolocation or indoctrination, but by principles and integrity. Yielding autonomy to a commanding officer is a concept that sits uneasily with me, although I imagine many young folks with similar feelings signed up for one of the armed forces based on national needs and personal interests.</p>
<p>While out driving with Michelle looking for a walking location we stopped at the Calverton National Cemetery. What better place to contemplate nationalistic ideals than in a final resting place created to honor and remember those who served in the enforcement of our nation's political principles. Some paid the ultimate sacrifice, dying in battle. Many others paid by suffering ever lasting physical and emotional scars. Their gravestones and crematorium markers gave me pause to consider the forces that drove them to sacrifice so much.</p>
<p>Fiscal costs and human costs are inseparably linked in violent military conflicts. The high costs of training, outfitting and resupplying soldiers, pilots and support personnel directly affect their safety and risk of casualty. I fear too often decisions are made by leaders who don't respect each individual life as much as they should. Unfathomably hard decisions are demanded of leaders to minimize casualties and end conflicts as soon as possible. Morale and blood, both from soldiers and civilians are the gritty currencies spent to achieve victory.</p>
<p>My thoughts are consumed by critical value while working to build a startup, but few things are comparable to human life. They are orthogonal measures in my mind. Loved ones and freedom are the only things I can equate to sacrificing one's life for. Neither of these has any financial equal. The question of what we're willing to die for is closely related to the question of what we live for.</p>
