<p>A dark, brooding alternative past where super heroes are outlawed and apparently hunted.&#0160; Incredible special effects combined with a compelling story and gritty heroes.&#0160; One in particular remained genuine throughout the films epic tale, Rorshach.&#0160; The hoarse voiced narrator through much of the film, appears hell bent on punishing anyone he sees as villain, the archetypal vigilante.&#0160; In my opinion the movie delivered, having read the original graphic novel many years ago (late 80s) I remembered the characters, but had forgotten most of the story.</p>
<p>Wait!<br />Hold on a second Mark, what&#39;s this have to do with nourishment for the soul?&#0160; That&#39;s easy.&#0160; Films, music, TV series, books, all types of media are just different methods for telling a story or marketing and sharing ones ideas.&#0160; At their worst, they&#39;re boring, sometimes painful wastes of our time.&#0160; At their best they can provide inspiration, provocative discussions, and stimulant our own imaginations.</p>
<p>My only disappointment with the film, Dr. Manhattan.&#0160; Unquestinably my favorite character from the graphic novel, he&#39;s got abilities which put him far beyond the realm of any of the other characters.&#0160; But he ends up being a tool in the movie (although an incredibly talented artist), and probably was as much of a pawn in the original graphic novel (I probably glossed over it then).</p>
