  content: Sounds like an interesting idea Mark. BTW, there is an image/hyperlink
    hovering over your text in the second sentence of your post.

  content: Aha, the free template I swapped to had a position absolute, which I&#39;ve
    quickly remedied into a position relative. Thanks for spotting that, should be
    on the bottom of the site/page now.<br><br>By the way if you&#39;re interested
    in converted some old posts into an ebook format, Aakin&#39;s your man. I think
    a rich free ebook is worth much more than $500-1000 (20-40 hours) in marketing
    dollars in the long run, certainly if it&#39;s cost to share is zero.

    though. Have to run out on a couple of errands.

  content: Good to see you blogging Mark!  Btw i never liked the little shop of horrors
    as a movie myself.  LOL!  Close distributed systems vs. the Open Web.  I&#39;ll
    take the OW anyday dude.. Btw excellent reference about the government.

  content: I read it and commented. Great points of warning about privacy concerns.
    We do have many choices about how to be social online, but we can&#39;t choose
    which networks our friends will be active on. The sooner full social web data
    migration occurs, the better. Many open standards are working to make that possible,
    but there&#39;s an ongoing issue of privacy and only anonymity can protect that.

  content: Thanks for stopping in Ahad. I&#39;ve been blogging pretty consistently
    since Feb in 2009 (about once per day). Glad you enjoyed the government reference,
    when social web becomes a utility it crosses the boundary from optional tool to
    a communication system people rely on (and may have rights to use).

  content: Not your fault the comment was on Ars Vox, when I accidentally nuked and
    restored my blog disqus got a little confused. Future comments should be ok.<br><br>I
    haven&#39;t read rails way much, it&#39;s not on me while walking so I read blogs/ebooks
    (Design patterns in Ruby is rocking). It&#39;s a great reference though. Helped
    a friend setup his first Mongrel localhost last night.

<p>Early last year I spent a few weeks gathering a number of my early blog posts into an ebook format (<a href="../2009/05/29/my-first-ebook/" target="_blank">3 Steps to Satisfaction</a>). It took me several weeks of part time work, and the final format was less than professional. Sure there are plenty of tools to aid manual conversion of ebook formats, but they have annoying glitches and require plenty of hands on editing to wade through. For my next blog to ebook* I’ve decided to go with a pro, and that decision has never been easier.</p>
<p>A life long^ friend of mine is leveraging his design skills in an area that myself and many others need a hand with: professionally converting blogs and books to various ebook formats. Aakin has over a decade of experience doing professional layout work for convention pamplets, books, and has added blog editing and conversion at my request. Trust me when I write that he is a wizard of formatting prowess. We’ll soon be releasing a free game book showing off his skills (he co-authored and edited <a href="http://www.victusgames.com/Welcome_to_Victus_Games.html" target="_blank">COTA</a>). I invite you to explore the details and negotiate specifics of your project or conversion at <a href="http://arsvox.com/" target="_blank">Ars Vox</a>. It’s as easy as sending an email, and covering a few hours of modest labor.</p>
<p>This simple act will:</p>
<ul>
<li>bring your blog message to an entirely different reader segment</li>
<li>or take an existing book and reach a much larger and growing audience of ebook readers</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any project that requires professional layout and design, <a href="http://arsvox.com/" target="_blank">Ars Vox</a> is the perfect way to get it done.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>*= I’m considering spinning two ebooks out of last years posts from April ‘09-10</p>
<p>^= after 15 years of being a close friend, you get the <em>life long friend</em> status to conceal my rapidly increasing age <img src="../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" /> . Aakin and I have been like brothers since college around 1992.</p>
