<ul>
<li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Singles want to break the ice with a stranger? Work together on a collaborative page.</span></li>
<li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Is your family spread out over great distances? Keep in touch and work together on a fun project.</span></li>
<li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Have a great idea, but need some more expert input? Open invitations or applications from other community members on a collaborative landing page.</span></li>
<li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Old friends moving on as new business opportunities entice them far and wide? Your good friends can now stay sinked up while sharing their creative energies and working towards a common goal.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The hosting business will be simple. Simply setup simple publishing pages, <strong>wildly customizable templates</strong>, html direct uploads, and revenue splits. The bargaining power of the host business will be collectively stronger for negotiating great affiliate rates and solid advertising deals. Older material becomes stale or outdated and requires periodic review to maintain strong interest for web browsers.<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Curating or continually refreshing old pages should be rewarded with favorable internal marketing and <a class="zem_slink" title="Revenue sharing" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_sharing">revenue sharing</a>. Taking a lesson from Squidoo, volunteer organizations can easily create their own community pages to support their favorite charity or non-profit.</span></p>
