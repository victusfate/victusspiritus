  content: Hi Mark.<br><br>I needed this inspiration this morning and have been questioning
    whether behaviors are really new or whether they are simply a translation of real
    life drives into online actions that sometimes intimate new possibilities.<br><br>I
    don&#39;t know whether it matters but it does affect how you position and focus.<br><br>My
    bet is that adoption is greater when you show how you take natural actions and
    they become something more when dropped into the powerful matrix of the social
    web.<br><br>Thanx for the nod and I&#39;m flattered to think I add some inspiration
    to your day.

  content: So to relate to a wider audience consider the natural forms of communication
    and how they can reward us by channeling them through the social web. Thanks another
    great tip!<br><br>By the way, you just made it into another post about spiritual
    consumption (I was talking about the rituals of my morning coffee, but thought
    of your love of wine, and Andy&#39;s Pappy).

<h2>Growth, Retention, and Traction</h2>
<p>The metrics that signal developers to early adoption are fuzzy. In addition to low cost analytics tools, we can monitor web page heat maps that track activity for different content areas. While this can teach us which parts of a page draw the eyes of a large group of browsers it's less intimate then the tried and true method of Q&amp;A. The alternative is my preferred approach: talk with folks who are generous enough to try out the software we build*. Web programmers have a good understanding of their own preferences and interests. For one we like hacking on new stuff (admittedly I'm a noob). But determining how a new application best translates into a sustainable market, takes more than hacking, it takes marketing intelligence, trial and error discovery, and copious truckloads of luck! When the stars align, and the market begins moving towards the hard earned tools you've crafted you've struck value gold.</p>
<h2>Satisfy Existing Needs, or Conjure Novel Behavior</h2>
<p>There's a <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2010/03/02/creating-versus-capturing-opportunities/">couple of primary methods</a> for growing an application to meet the needs of a consumer market.</p>
<ul>
<li>Concentrate on current behavior by providing utility that is both enjoyable and memorable (odd how those two aspects are separate). The target issue is either an existing challenge that is handled with a new technique, or a new resultant challenge (information overload). Either way the problem focus exists in the market already</li>
<li>Create fresh opportunities by introducing new user behavior. This can be accomplished through a combination of game psychology and by offerring adjacent business value for adopting the behaviorial pattern (<a class="zem_slink" title="Foursquare" rel="homepage" href="http://www.foursquare.com">Foursquare</a> deals for checking in). Startups that excel in fostering the spread of a social pattern (meme) can alter the foundations of the web ecosystem</li>
</ul>
<p>Businesses can grow to leverage both methods to satisfy user and customer needs, but for starters it's a smart bet to focus on one or the other. The focus will empower you to trail blaze a bright future for your community that others are sure to follow.</p>
