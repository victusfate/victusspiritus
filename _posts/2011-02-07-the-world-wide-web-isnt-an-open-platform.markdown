  content: 'Disregarding non-coders, creating applications is still difficult even
    for veteran coders. There is so much that continues to change, and so much breadth
    of knowledge required, that a simple application becomes somewhat difficult. Even
    with the general object-oriented reuse that people try for, building reusable
    components beyond simple frameworks is tremendously difficult. Disappointingly,
    with the rise of mobile devices, I do not see this constant change halting at
    all. '

  content: I think your definition of open is rather wrong. Open is not "any idiot
    with 5 minutes can create something meaningful." Open is the ability to get hosting
    so that you can put whatever you want online. Open is the ability to make a site
    that takes a contrary view to whatever you want and not have to fear it being
    taken down. The web is open to you trying to use Beanstalk all you want. It is
    open in so far as there are support conduits for the tool. It is open because
    the whole idea was possible since some mega-corporation cannot come in a squash
    it because it doesn't use their proprietary database.

  content: "I respect your definition, but there's something missing. Web app development
    is only accessible to a few of us (couple of percent of the population). \n\nI
    know blogging platforms have pushed simple publications, but there are many web
    app use cases that will never happen because there's not enough incentive to support
    specialists hacking them out. My brother can carefully define a use case (identify
    breaking articles on telescopes on a handful of sites), but doesn't know enough
    about where to begin with web programming to code it up. He should be able to
    create single serving apps like that without having to understand installation
    of gem dependencies, source control/sharing, etc.\n\nI want \"any idiot with 5
    minutes\" to be able to construct their own web living utility. There's value
    in the organization in their heads that isn't making the jump to shareable media.\n\n\n"

    TWITTER OR BOOKMARK PAGE. YAHOO TRY CUSTOM APP THING WITH YAHOO PIPES. IT BIG
    SURPRISE WHEN ONLY HACKERS USE IT. \n\nDRAG AND DROP PROGRAMMING HOLY GRAIL THAT
    EVEN INDIANA JONES NEVER COME BACK WITH. IT SAME AS BUILD HOUSE. ANYONE CAN DO,
    BUT UNLESS WILLING TO LEARN FROM LOTS OF MISTAKES OR ALREADY PROFESSIONAL CARPENTER,
    NO ONE WANT TO LIVE IN THAT HOUSE."

    That explains Facebook's meteoric success in capturing and maintaining people's interest.

    I've played with pipes, still too crowded of an interface for non-coding folks. The tool has to be far more constrained, and even easier to use than subscribing to a feed (failed for broad news reading). The blocks have to be fun, simple and EASY to use and piece together. Putting functions together has to be more like a jigsaw puzzle and less like yahoo pipes.  I've got some ideas to jot down.

    NO ONE HAVE PROBLEM OF "CAN'T BUILD APP", THEM HAVE PROBLEM LIKE "CAN'T GET X DATA IN Y WAY". DIFFERENT VALUE OF X AND Y PROBABLY DIFFERENT APP, NOT ONE APP TO RULE THEM ALL.

    MAYBE CAN SEE SOMETHING THAT LEVERAGE LOTS OF PUBLIC APIS TO TIE SERVICES TOGETHER, BUT THAT ALREADY CROWDED SPACE. AND HARD TO MAINTAIN. EVERYTHING BREAK ANY TIME ONE API CHANGE.

<i>We're doing it wrong</i></p>
<p>My family can send email, make phone calls, and navigate well designed user interfaces. I'd call those unequivocal open platforms for participation. Yet building web tools is broken for regular folks. The vast majority of people with access, can't create web apps to satisfy their needs. My argument is that there is enormous potential for billions of personal apps, if only people can piece them together. The small fraction of adept web hackers won't be coding up apps of a personal nature because they're not profitable or relevant beyond an individual's need. Open to only a few, isn't indicative of an open platform.</p>
<p>Last night I spent an hour browsing through web documentation on how to setup an Amazon Elastic Beanstalk with a JRuby on Rails test server. I have a broad coding background, and the last couple of years include web development. I'll admit that I'm not in the same category as the web hacking elite I learn from, but I'm a <i>confident amateur</i>*. I expected a smooth installation for remote app deployment from Elastic Beanstalk, but after bumping into a few problems with mysql (activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter helped) and simply creating the database I had to admit the technology is not quite ready for mainstream adoption. I'll get it working later this week when I steal a few moments, but this made me aware of just how tough creating web apps is for non-coders. </p>
<p><i>One click for a hello world app, two to request and parse remote data, and three to process the returned information</i></p>
<p>What possible advantage can there be to making dynamic web application servers overly complicated to install and utilize? There's little real value in obscure programming interfaces for web app development. The proof will be evident when viable technologies gravitate towards the lowest barrier to entry and follow that design with a rich toolkit. The easy entry app environments will gain traction while arcane architectures fade into obscurity.</p>
<p>Only when simple web applications are commoditized, will we enjoy the richness of a diverse app landscape where all people are encouraged to participate. Contrary to the belief that this will result in lower need for professional web developers, the opposite will occur. An unlimited wave of personal apps will drive demand for beautiful front ends, and complex constructs which are capable of intelligently and productively weaving billions of services together. Professional web designers and developers will be in higher demand than ever before.</p>
<p>Notes:<br />
* = <i>confident amateur</i> defined: I no longer have fear of pouring over tutorials, github repos, documents and books. I've built Rails and Sinatra apps before with a few different interpreters (thanks <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/">rvm</a>), as well as simple PHP, Python and Scala examples. I've deployed to a variety of remote hosts like Hostmonster, <a href="http://www.couchone.com/">CouchOne</a>, Heroku and the Google App Engine. </p>
