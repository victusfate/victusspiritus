<p>The fall itself is momentary pain, and perhaps a few laughs to folks that want to see you fold. It takes guts, heart, and the perfect dose of foolhardiness to get back up. The moment the fallen rise, they capture my fascination. In that instant they are titans.</p>
<p>Some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qROcza8o71c">falls</a> are notably harder to get up from. That's where a good insurance policy kicks in.</p>
