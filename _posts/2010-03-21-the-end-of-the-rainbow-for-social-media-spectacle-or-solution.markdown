  content: 'yup, information overload is a real problem !<br>Lists are good to organizing
    the people in a general area (friends/coworkers/random/design/coding and what
    not) but there needs to be a filter on top of those. You&#39;ve got no idea how
    much I would love that ! I&#39;m struggling as to how I can get rid of the political
    tweets in my timeline without actually unfollowing people....<br>In regards to
    twitter, a curation/filter tool based on the hashtags used ? altough not everyone
    uses # every time....<br>This problem seems like it is the cause to why some users
    don&#39;t engage on conversations. <br><br>irrelevant ps : batch reading done.
    off to bed :) Thank you for your posts mark !'

  content: Everyone has their own signal and interests, systems work differently for
    different people. Nobody is right or wrong with their approaches as long as it
    works for them. Hopefully with some trial and error, everyone learns how their
    mind works and which information tool/circles they can use to assist them.

  content: I&#39;m probably only familiar with a tip of the social media ice berg,
    compared to you, but I am certainly aware of the information overload. The other
    issue with it -- and it&#39;s a related one -- is the lack of voice for minnows
    in the stream. Perhaps one solution would be some sort of algorithm that could
    scan click on embedded links in Twitter, for example, and assign them quality
    scores. Then people could screen out some minnow noise and get more minnow signal.
    And with fewer minnows, the minnows left would get a little bigger.

  content: 'Mark, if I have lost sight of anything it would be the rainbow and not
    social media.  Whenever I enter any church I respectfully listen to the religion
    that is preached, why should any social media alter be any different?<br><br>I
    believe that it is a sign of adaptive growth when people customize technology
    to their own way. Conformity means we can all have a similar experience, but people
    who deviate from the system are usually undesirable, for whatever becomes free
    as a bird is hard to measure, harder to capitalize and also disruptive. Having
    said that the problem with variety in social media is both legacy and obsolescence.
    <br><br>To that end, if one wants to ensure that there is a continuity of social
    media application, social media has to be personal consideration as to the how
    and why of our own personal use (rather than a technology congregation).  <br><br>That
    use includes backing up our own content on old media - but content isn&#39;t a
    big issue for me - the chief problem with social media as I see it is that the
    de facto meme is that we are using to publish and/or get our content read by others
    (as if this is the only way to use media).<br><br>I would not prescribe others
    to read what I write simply because I write to think and deconstruct.  On the
    way I pick up intelligence on the travel by cause of accident not by cause of
    social media.  Any one who is going to read what I write is simply out of respect,
    and here reading implies the gift of thinking rather than consuming.<br><br>One
    such accidental tourist is Dave Pinsen, I would never have thought about Spinoza
    on my online journey if he did not stand up and speak to his greater experience.  On
    the way I learned that rigor is an essential trait in the make up of one&#39;s
    self-development.<br><br>I don&#39;t however want to become an identity of Twitter,
    or Buzz or even a clone of Dave Pinsen (only because I want to be free to flow
    than follow) - and more so because my cause is to discover emergence.  <br><br>I
    think I have more or less stayed true to that journey but on the way there is
    the odd wake up call i.e. when I am so immersed in social media that I don&#39;t
    notice looking out of my window and just enjoying the appearance of a real rainbow.<br><br>If
    I can look at the beauty of social media as I enjoy a rainbow without attempting
    to describe it, I have got back to an emergent way.  Yesterday I frequented through
    Ryan Grave&#39;s home and he used that lovely word "verbose" - (in a really good
    way).<br><br>That little interjection was yet another accident that I enjoyed
    playing with.  Now I do realize emergent discovery does not involve rigor, but
    one way is to enjoy developing both i.e. the adaptive life and the rigorous life
    - and know when each is appropriate.  <br><br>If I am focused fully on my path,
    I won&#39;t pay as much attention to Robert Scoble or a social media "star" -
    but I will notice Ryan Graves, Dave Pinsen, and some guy called Mark; as well
    as a multitude of voices that may or will merge into my own journey, no matter
    who they are or how brightly they might shine. <br><br>Do I then call this journey
    "a rainbow" or recognize that in the naming of things, some things just are and
    so let them be - so do I personally need a label called social media?<br><br>Only
    if I am here to sell it or turn it a personal branding machine.  We are all selling
    something but when we speak what is in our hearts or mind, at the end of this
    particular rainbow is always the same thing in my opinion - a life well lived.  "A
    life well lived" is emergent when it is alive or becomes a epitaph on our grave
    stone.  I prefer it to be the former and so it is that verbose becomes a synonym
    for freeform play and free spirited interaction - but push it through the social
    media machine and it turns into "signal vs. noise".   Let other people fight their
    own wars if they believe some holy principle of a media religion is being transgressed,
    because I am off to read Spinoza:<br><br><a href="http://alwayson.goingon.com/permalink/post/34666#comment-21018"
    rel="nofollow">http://alwayson.goingon.com/permalink/post/3466...</a><br><br>...
    so my summary: as long as we are picking something on the way social media remains
    a synonym for "freedom" - *until that is, we either get labeled by it or our prescription
    is to live that label.<br><br>*And that ain&#39;t me bro :-)<br><br><b>[Em]</b>'

  content: Yeah, different levels of filtering is what I&#39;m working on. Users can
    create feeds which can represent groups, but we do further processing on the stream
    I information by tag. Semantic or user supplied - still working out the details,
    but user supplied tags are generally good but biased towards one personal use
    of language. Community sourced tags would be best

  content: Thanks for stopping by, and I so believe personalized filters are the best
    solution. I just don&#39;t feel that I have very good ones yet, so I keep my follow
    lists very small where I&#39;m active (Twitter/buzz).

  content: Alas you have seen how greedy I am with my time that I want to find wonderful
    information and ideas, but not have to read through all the unrelated stuff.<br><br>I
    also believe many others who don&#39;t yet enjoy social media as much as myself,
    could begin the exploration with the right tools. Thanks for reminding me of the
    importance in freedom when it comes to discovery and learning.

  content: Everybody&#39;s time is a gift so one can never be greedy with time, the
    gift here is the home called victusspiritus that you have provided.  I always
    go back to Douglas Adams when it comes to learn to love the internet:<br><br><a
    href="http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/19990901-00-a.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/19990901-00-a.html</a><br><br>I
    am a nomad on the Internet, though I utilize AlwaysOn, I do so by making it my
    cave rather than my home, so freedom for me is different than if I had to maintain
    a cyberhome on the net.  Maybe when there are more nomads like me, all this talk
    of tribe will be a virtue, rather than a migration to online cities such as Facebook.<br><br>I
    don&#39;t want to make the industrialization of the internet an issue, I simply
    want a space where I can think.  People like you, Ryan Graves, the people on my
    Twitter account including the wonderful Liz Strauss - give me room to think and
    to be myself. <br><br>Being a web nomad also allows me to do something that the
    branded life cannot which is to disappear for a month, I wrote about this peace
    of mind today at AlwaysOn :<br><br><a href="http://alwayson.goingon.com/permalink/post/34716"
    rel="nofollow">http://alwayson.goingon.com/permalink/post/34716</a><br><br>This
    means that I will be returning on 22nd April 2010 -  a month away from the online
    space because I choose to, not because I am going on a vacation.   A month away
    because using the net is no different to going to my kitchen.   As Douglas Adams
    said so well what we are experiencing is a restoration.  I think Adams would be
    a bit perplexed if he was still alive, that we have not understood his basic message
    over a decade after he has written it.<br><br>When the web becomes as normal as
    buying a house, it won&#39;t be about enjoying social media, but living with something
    that shouldn&#39;t even need a name - it should be that natural to the human condition.<br><br>See
    ya in April, in the meantime I lined myself some paper based books to indulge
    - (but I will sneak online to review the Spinoza work).  The web blossoms when
    we are free to go to all parts of it, rather than directed to the cities.  I am
    nomad and I sign off with my nomadic salute :<br><br>SEEEEEE YAAAAA SAME PLACE
    SAAAME CHANNEL IN APRIL !!!<br><br>Yes, Mark it is another dip into my intelligent
    silence because I need to have "Peace With Everything" :-)<br><br><b>[Em]</b>

  content: 'I too find that turning data (the river) into information is difficult.<br><br>Lists
    help but, as you point out, people aren&#39;t always on topic and you ultimately
    have to sift through more and more noise. <br><br>Saved searches often work well,
    but then you may not be exposed to new and related topics. They might be too narrow.<br><br>FriendFeed&#39;s
    Friend of a Friend feature was/is the closest thing I&#39;ve found to solving
    this problem. However, it takes a discipline that many in social media haven&#39;t
    embraced: follow fewer people. <br><br>I&#39;m a Dunbar&#39;s Number proponent
    (though I don&#39;t use it for Twitter) and shape FriendFeed (home feed) and Buzz
    based on this principle. The key, particularly in FriendFeed is to use people
    as filters for specific topics. Find subject matter experts and use them to bring
    you the best on those topics.<br><br>I wrote about this last year: <a href="http://www.blindfiveyearold.com/soylent-green-is-filters"
    rel="nofollow">http://www.blindfiveyearold.com/soylent-green-i...</a><br><br>I
    still rely on Louis Gray, Rob Diana, Mike Fruchter, Atul Aurora and Mahendra to
    keep me on the cutting edge - and they do a great job. <br><br>Others provide
    the same service for different topics outside of technology. And you can&#39;t
    just set it and forget it. People change. Interests change. <br><br>It will be
    interesting to see if anyone can build a better mousetrap or convince people not
    to follow too many people.'

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Another Breathtaking HDR shot from Trey Ratcliff (click the image to see more of his work)</em></p>
<p>I hopped into a conversation related to how <a href="http://www.skepticgeek.com/rss/how-i-live-and-breathe-google-reader/">Mahendra's Palsule's</a> organizes Google Reader. It took place under <a class="zem_slink" title="Louis Gray" rel="homepage" href="http://louisgray.com/">Louis Gray</a>'s Buzz share, and <a class="zem_slink" title="Robert Scoble" rel="homepage" href="http://www.google.com/profiles/scobleizer">Robert Scoble</a> commented how few page views and little attention was driven by Google Reader &amp; Buzz as of late. Here's a <a href="http://www.google.com/buzz/louisgray/QBqqTf5YVqn/Some-strong-analysis-by-Mahendra-into-how-he-uses">link</a> to the conversation, I'll quote the relevant section:</p>
<div>
<div id="z13ezdcwdl3rsno4e04cdphrguast11gpec#1269164063365000">
<blockquote>
<div><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com/profiles/messel#buzz">Mark Essel</a> - @Robert How many people actively use Twitter?<br />
@Louis how many actively use greader<br />
how many use buzz?</p>
<p>How many tech geeks use the above tools?</p>
<p>How many normal folks give a crap about our favorite flavor of web info?</p>
<p>My problem with social media is that it's dominated by talking about itself, it's ecosystem, etc. To "grow up" it needs to be something we don't see/stare at/worship and just use to find great info and interesting people. Another issue with all social media is that it's focused on super human filters, and blog stars. I'd prefer the social reader learn what I like and let me tune it<br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com/profiles/scobleizer#buzz"></a></p>
</div>
<div><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com/profiles/scobleizer#buzz">Robert Scoble</a> - Mark: humans will always be better than automation. 5:35 am</div>
<div><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com/profiles/messel#buzz">Mark Essel</a> - Ps: black box implicit knowledge engines don't help me. I have to understand why and how a system selects information I may find relevant</div>
<div><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com/profiles/messel#buzz">Mark Essel</a> - Agree, But humans don't scale. I can't dial up a personal Scoble Twitter filter catered to my interests, that learns about what most gets me jazzed up over time.</div>
<div><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com/profiles/scobleizer#buzz">Robert Scoble</a> - Mark: I don't know the latest numbers but in talking with friends in blogging at sxsw we are getting many times more traffic from Twitter than from Buzz or Google Reader.</div>
<div><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com/profiles/scobleizer#buzz">Robert Scoble</a> - Mark: that is what Twitter lists are good for.</div>
<div><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com/profiles/mitchell.trish#buzz">Trish (Red Fox)</a> - @Robert -- Buzz is only a month old, after all!!  Twitter is 4.  Be interesting to see the stats when Buzz is 4.  :)</div>
<div><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com/profiles/scobleizer#buzz">Robert Scoble</a> - Techmeme actually does a pretty good job. So does Regator and a few others. I like humans better, though, noisy baahhhssstttaarrdddsss they might be. :-)</div>
<div><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com/profiles/scobleizer#buzz">Robert Scoble</a> - Trish: Buzz is a disaster. Traffic here is dropping. I sure hope they fix it soon.</div>
<div><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com/profiles/messel#buzz">Mark Essel</a> - I like lists :). Unless people split their streams into very narrow categories they have issues.</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p>I mentioned that Social Media is still too self involved. We're preoccupied by how we handle tech news and information, as opposed to talking about great new tech, software, geek glory. Even in this blog post I'm only adding to that sign of immaturity as I discuss the weaknesses of the social web. <em>The problem of relevancy to individual readers is a distraction from quality analysis</em>.</p>
<h2>Information Overload</h2>
<p>As much as I appreciate the fine coverage of Robert, Louis, and Mahendra at finding fantastic tech news, I can't fine tune their information streams to my personal interests. Even though I'm able to filter their shares with some effort, I can't change their attention to focus on what's most interesting to me. Robert mentioned lists (or groups feeds for open web alternatives), but almost every person shares a diversity of information. Their interests aren't a narrow laser beam of knowledge on a given topic (which is a good thing), but it makes filtering real time info that's relevant to me a challenge. As long as it's required that casual or normal web users have to sift through mountains of garbage to find a few pearls of information most relevant to them, social media sharing is failing the majority. The challenge is for us to reinvent how new content and media is rated, and rises to the attention of curious browsers without a heavy time commitment. Many startups and large knowledge systems are working hard on this problem, and I look forward to offering <a href="http://victusmedia.com">our spin</a> on a solution shortly.</p>
