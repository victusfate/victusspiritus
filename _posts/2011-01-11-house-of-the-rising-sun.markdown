  content: Glad you enjoyed it. My coworker was telling me how he learned to play
    the minor chords when he was 12, got a little jealous since I never learned guitar
    beyond a little dabbling in high school. My dad played though.

<p>Every so often the morning mall radio will surprise me with great music. For the past couple of years it was terrible pop music. More recently the ethereal <i>Simon's Mall DJ</I> has switched to an oldies station, an appropriate selection for the retired walking crowd plus me.</p>
<p>After listening to House of the Rising Sun, a familiar but mysterious tune, I was compelled to read the <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_of_the_Rising_Sun?wasRedirected=true">backstory of the song</a> on wikipedia. If you are curious about the origin of ballads*, it's a rich history. The melody has roots in an English song <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matty_Groves">Matty Groves</a>, and the interpretation  of the lyrics are a toss up between a brothel, bar or jail.</p>
<blockquote><p>
The Animals' version transposes the narrative of the song from the point of view of a woman led into a life of degradation, to that of a male, whose father was now a gambler and drunkard, as opposed to the sweetheart in earlier versions.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes:<br />
*= I didn't realize I was curious about ballad history until writing this post.</p>
<p>Here are the <a href="http://www.lyrics007.com/The%20Animals%20Lyrics/House%20Of%20The%20Rising%20Sun%20Lyrics.html">lyrics</a> to the variation performed by the Animals.</p>
<blockquote><p>
There is a house in New Orleans <br />
They call the Rising Sun <br />
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy <br />
And God I know I'm one </p>
<p>My mother was a tailor <br />
She sewed my new bluejeans <br />
My father was a gamblin' man <br />
Down in New Orleans </p>
<p>Now the only thing a gambler needs <br />
Is a suitcase and trunk <br />
And the only time he's satisfied <br />
Is when he's on a drunk </p>
<p>------ organ solo ------ </p>
<p>Oh mother tell your children <br />
Not to do what I have done <br />
Spend your lives in sin and misery <br />
In the House of the Rising Sun </p>
<p>Well, I got one foot on the platform <br />
The other foot on the train <br />
I'm goin' back to New Orleans <br />
To wear that ball and chain </p>
<p>Well, there is a house in New Orleans <br />
They call the Rising Sun <br />
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy <br />
And God I know I'm one <br />
</blockquote</p>
