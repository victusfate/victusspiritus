    An address that sounds more like "K Street" might well raise a few flags, yet I reserve judgement at any form disruption which wasn't already disrupting the moment it came into the cold eye of reality.  I remember once watching the movie "Brewsters Millions" and the joke was a "None of the Above" candidate, I was surprised to read on wikipedia that NOTA has been on the ballot :

    <b>Wikipedia NOTA</b>
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None_of_the_above

    Which leads me to the kind of reality checks that George Carlin has left indelibelly imprinted in the world of home truth comedy

    <b>George Carlin Doesn't Vote</b>
    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIraCchPDhk

    I note that Carlin is the kind of comedy that can make us think, but more often than not it is resigned laughter at the absurdity of it all.  The question to ask is whether there is a political system that one wants to emigrate to that is the nirvana of representative politics.  I don't see it anywhere on Planet Politician.  Carlin points his noodle at the great public and though he is now dead, his comedy can be juxtapositioned to a slogan just four years ago called "Yes we can".  

    Even today when the trending topic on Twitter was #fuckwashington and I saw that people like Jeff Jarvis picked up on it, I can't ignore all the other trending topics that are as sadly comic as any sketch George Carlin could pan - which seem to be a cross-section of football players, musicians, movies and political slogans that resemble more like "No we can't".   It is not that George Carlin took the easy route through black comedy, he went to rehab for alcohol and pain killer medication, but judge for yourself in this montage of Carlin :

    Now I ask myself fours years after this death, how do I even begin to "vote for change" in any nation which say change is by the vote?

  content: I'm a fan of Carlin's serious comedy and wit. Will certainly review the
    links to see if they ring a bell. The extreme representative possibilities go
    beyond voting, and touch upon rewriting or authoring change. This is where politics
    can go if we allow it to change.

  content: "Lets look at this from another way - the \"X\" vote of Malcolm X.   If
    George Carlin is telling us that the value of a vote isn't that much, then Malcolm
    X explores the other side of the political value stream - the actual committees
    that have power - have a good listen to this, go beyond the racism and the emotional
    energy created in this conversation and get to the core and center of real power
    that Malcolm X describes here :\n\n<b>Malcolm X at the Oxford University Debate</b>\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmzaaf-9aHQ\n\nSo
    then how do you think technology can be utilized to drive change?\n\nI say change
    first has to have a measure and on the George Carlin side of the political landscape
    that measure is what is the real cost of an election.  Want to disrupt an industry
    then first see what Carlin is saying in terms of the industry that has been built
    to satisfy itself.  If technology use simply improves a broken system then I for
    one would still stay at home, it simply moves dollars from advertising, PR and
    marketing companies to new industries of political technology.  If the cost of
    a election goes way down, a lot of vote related industries will of course will
    face huge disruption.  \n\nThen at the other end on the Malcolm X side of the
    political landscape, the measure is the end to end political value improvement. 
    Then one does not simply begin to change politics from the public voting end,
    but dig deeper into the core, the middle, the heart of political action (the very
    stuff of politics that Malcolm X addresses in the video above) and figure out
    how to utilize technology to improve the supply line between political decisions
    and return on vote.  If we can measure ROI (return on investment) with advances
    in technology - why can't we measure \"return on vote\"?  That is what I take
    away from the Malcolm X video.\n\nI write these tidbits out not to entertain,
    not to pontificate, not to make a point, but to just think, to test the rivets
    IN MY MIND and see how much of my industrial aged education begins to fall away
    and fall out - and maybe in the years ahead, if I keep thinking in wide circles
    like this, I might just develop a 21st Century brain, but in the process I hope
    to meet a 21st Century world in the making - and both require new ways of thinking,
    new ways of doing and of course new ways of looking and discerning the yet unimagined
    leverage of technology.  \n\n<b>[Em]</b>"

<p>I was overly optimistic and enthusiastic as I perused a post about a novel third party throwing down the gauntlet for the next US presidential election. The party would be driven by internet based delegates and candidates. The entire structure at first appeared as the ideal flat organization removing any barriers or biases from the electoral process.</p>
<blockquote><p>
“Our goal is to open up what has been an anticompetitive process to people in the middle who are unsatisfied with the choices of the two parties,” said Kahlil Byrd, the C.E.O. of Americans Elect, speaking from its swank offices, financed with some serious hedge-fund money, a stone’s throw from the White House.</p>
<p>As the group explains on its Web site, www.americanselect.org: “Americans Elect is the first-ever open nominating process. We’re using the Internet to give every single voter — Democrat, Republican or independent — the power to nominate a presidential ticket in 2012. The people will choose the issues. The people will choose the candidates. And in a secure, online convention next June, the people will make history by putting their choice on the ballot in every state.”<br />
(source below)
</p></blockquote>
<p>I should have suspected the political disruption would be more hand waving, and less action based on the "swank offices" and hedge fund backing. Why would an Internet based political organization require such heavy funding? Why should they be centralized in Washington DC?</p>
<p>AmericanSelect.org had me onboard until they suggested the presidential candidate must obey <i>stature</i> requirements of previous presidents. </p>
<blockquote><p>
Any presidential nominee must conform to all the Constitutional requirements, <b>as well as be considered someone of similar stature to our previous presidents</b>. That means no Lady Gaga allowed.<br />
(source below)
</p></blockquote>
<p>The constitutional requirements for president are in need of serious review, and the the secondary condition based on stature is repugnant. Who decides who has sufficient stature? We do, all of us, not some select sub group. I say we should let the people decide, for better or for worse. </p>
<p>Our democracy will ultimately suffer because the few fail to trust in the many. Many voices are made inconsequential by archaic electoral practices and an aging bureaucracy.</p>
