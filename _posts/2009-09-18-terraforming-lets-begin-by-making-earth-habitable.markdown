  content: Urban Renewal, very political of you ;) No seriously- on the flip, when
    you talk about hosuing and living, you talk about culture and how we want to live,
    and what makes for  family or community structures.<br><br>Sustainable is also
    bring cultures to life.  How about investigating what k makes cultures come alive,
    and technologies impact on culture?  Most people rarely wonder how more conservative
    cultures take to technolog best you take a look!

  content: I&#39;m actually a big fan of HUGE concepts like terraforming habitable
    environments, but I think before we consider spending many billions of dollars
    on building something on the order of a "moon base" (there is  some great effort
    going on for global/unified efforts), we should spend a little effort improving
    the habitats we already have. Worst case, maybe we can do the jobs in parallel.

<h2>Earth-shaping</h2>
<p>The concept of making foreign worlds habitable was discussed in detail by Carl Sagan (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraforming">initially Venus then Mars</a>), and has continued to be a topic of interest of legendary moon walker, Buzz Aldrin. The entire system of transforming even a small encapsulated dome must be automated, compartmentalized, and redundant. I can envision the process of bringing a life supporting environment as a series of automated tasks, being both beautiful and efficient. But there's so much of own planet that we have yet to use.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Consider the following far out environments:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">the surface of the ocean </span></li>
<li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">deep beneath the waves</span></li>
<li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">the frozen surface of Antarctica</span></li>
<li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">great cities that defy the laws of gravity by hovering high in the atmosphere</span></li>
</ul>
<p>There is so much untapped and unused space on our own planet that we can use to create healthy ecosystems in, before we reach out to other planets. We are challenged by efforts to protect existing ecosystems. Over fishing and deforestation are powerful human-centric forces that require careful moderation and measurement to avoid catastrophic environmental effects. The <a class="zem_slink" title="Greenhouse effect" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect">green house effect</a> is perhaps the most powerful atmospheric alteration. The changes to the world's climates based on industrialization is an area of ongoing research.</p>
<h2>Living Conditions</h2>
<p>Taking the idea of world forming further, it is important to focus on the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Have we truly made both healthy and <a class="zem_slink" title="Sustainable living" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_living">sustainable living</a> conditions for humanity or other life here on Earth? </span></li>
<li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">What about the classic metropolitan slums, or impoverished areas? </span></li>
<li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Have we learned enough to shape our cities in a way that minimizes dangerous living conditions?</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If we aren't continually asking these questions, what gives us the right to go forth to other worlds only to make the same mistakes over and over again. In my mind, we must prove that we can build healthy conditions for life on Earth before we unconsciously subject other worlds to our experimentation. Seeding barren worlds with life is a natural counter to this argument, and to that I can't object.</p>
