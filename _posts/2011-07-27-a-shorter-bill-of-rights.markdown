    Err, that sounds really cool in theory but it can be used to be even more restrictive in practice.

    That means I couldn't call someone that acts like an asshole and asshole, even if it's the truth. It may harm him.

  content: 'So the government is allowed to impinge on my rights if they deem that
    I *intended* to harm someone?  How do you propose for the government to discern
    my intent?  I fear your shortened version is far too vague.  One of the most important,
    and under-appreciated rights listed in the actual Bill of Rights is the 9th: "The
    enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny
    or disparage others retained by the people." '

  content: I'm not suggesting that government be psychic, probable cause isn't a novel
    concept, and courts are pretty good places to bring up evidence. Stopping folks
    before they do serious damage is not only possible, it's a requirement of a free
    society.

  content: Intent to do harm is only half of the requirement to prove a crime.  The
    other half is an actual criminal act.  "Probable cause" is usually interpreted
    to mean that there is reasonable suspicion that a person has committed a crime.
     Stopping a drunk driver meets the definition because swerving all over the road
    is evidence that someone is drunk and driving while drunk is a crime. Your definition
    doesn't require a crime be committed so it reads like George Bush's justification
    for pre-emptive war to me.  Prudent, perhaps, but certainly not legal.

  content: "Agree that it's not black and white, but more complex rule based systems
    don't necessarily effect safer outcomes. We rely in the judgement of law enforcers
    and they are (should be) held to same laws as ourselves. \nIn your thinking can
    law enforcement or citizens stop an individual before they commit a harmful act?
    If they can, should they?"

<p>The government is only allowed to impinge on an individual's rights when that individual's actions or intended actions will harm other unwilling participants.</p>
