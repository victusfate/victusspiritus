  content: Freedom can be used to mean different things. Free particles exist in a
    0 potential space, free car wash costs no money, and then there&#39;s freedom
    of human action. <br><br>Freedom for humans is the state where other humans do
    not restrict your actions by force. What that force can be must be carefully defined
    for freedom to be non-contradictory, but the general idea is that your body, your
    property, and your thoughts and words are not to be interfered with against your
    will. <br><br>Some people say that a hungry man is never free. This is a misuse
    of the word. The hungry man is either free or not depending on whether force is
    initiated against him by others (through violations of his body or property).
    You might say that he is suffering, or that he is struggling, but these are not
    the same as freedom. <br><br>You say that there&#39;s a strong correlation between
    freedom and chaos, but, in the case of human freedom, think of the least free
    historical examples, and consider whether these were stable, or chaotic. When
    life is subject to the whims of mad men, chaos, not stability, ensues.

  content: Great thoughts Loidicus (too much Sparticus watching the last couple  <br>of
    days). I get the sense you spend as much time as myself preoccupied  <br>with
    thoughts of personal freedom.<br><br>A hungry man can be free, and he can exchange
    his freedom for food. He  <br>was driven by hunger, so was he ever free to begin
    with, or merely a  <br>pawn of his hunger?<br><br>By chaos I mean it&#39;s unpredictability.
    If we can predict events and  <br>actions the "freedom" part loses it&#39;s meaning.
    Agree that stable  <br>societies are for the greater part seen in a positive light.
    But  <br>contrast that with violent and bloody revolutions which may lead to  <br>greater
    individual freedom (overthrowing tyrants/attrocities).

  content: When you brought up unpredictability, it got me thinking... We are able
    to see into the future, in a limited way. For example, i know that if i start
    a pencil rolling off my desk, it will fall within a short time.<br><br>This is
    actually seeing the future.<br><br>I suppose the only thing keeping us from seeing
    farther into the future, is the uncertainty of data at our disposal. Frequently,
    that source of uncertainty is from other people... humans being one of the most
    chaotic elements of a formula.<br><br>But what about after we have created strong
    AI? I&#39;m sure there will come a time when strong AI will have so much data
    about our minds, bodies, and human action/reaction profiling that they will be
    able to tell the future of the human race far into the future.(without them intervening
    of course).<br><br>Telling the future isn&#39;t magical, it is just a matter of
    having the right data at hand and reading it correctly. :)

<h2>Rich in Choices: Freedom, Flexibility, & Commitment</h2>
<p>Freedom is an easy idea to comprehend at first glance, but a challenging concept to fully grasp. It is the absence of restrictions. It's a pole diametrically opposed to predictable events. There's a strong correlation between freedom and chaos, but they are not equivalents. Living with absolute freedom is physically impossible and anything close to it is highly detrimental to life. Biological building blocks are complex but systematic, requiring a certain level of order for life to exist. </p>
<p>While the processes of life are better served closer to the poles of determinism and order, our personal sense of freedom is driven by a mix of individual and social forces*. As soon as we limit our freedom to a set of fixed options, it drastically approaches a predictable outcome. Most of our lives are spent optimizing choices in this limited opportunity space, and it's where we focus the majority of our attention and energy. </p>
<h2>Freedom is the measure of flexibility a person has in their daily choices</h2>
<p>If you have to go the same place to do the same thing five or seven days a week you may not feel very liberated. We are challenged to find free thought in the same restricted activities. Fortunately we are capable of introducing unpredictable creativity even in habitual tasks. Beyond that we can work to nourish a life that is full of opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li>building a large pool of capital through high value work/business</li>
<li>having a healthy network of friends and family, an introduction at the right moment can be priceless</li>
<li>A highly flexible & dynamic job. Find a new aspect to love about your work, while creating an ideal balance between work & personal life</li>
</ul>
<h2>An Analogy in Physics</h2>
<p>Quantum mechanical particles represent a relationship between unknown (free) and measured (determined) states. The state of a quantum mechanical particle is represented by a probability distribution. There is a chance it is in one of several possible states which are only compressed down to a single state through measurement. The particles transition from a state of greater to lesser freedom. </p>
<h2>Some Commitments are more Primal than Choices</h2>
<p>It's a little different for me now writing about the concepts of flexibility and rigidity, but not just as a newlywed. It was a few years before the ceremony where we both communicated our feelings and desire to share our lives together. Some decisions, like my life long commitment and marriage to Michelle, are as simple and fundamental as breathing. The loss of "flexibility" isn't even a consideration. There was nothing resembling a decision, there was only an irresistable feeling of <a HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism"><i>this is the way</I></a>.</p>
<p>Notes:<br />
*= it's a little off topic for an already long post to dive into cultural effects on individual freedom, but worth me reading up on </p>
