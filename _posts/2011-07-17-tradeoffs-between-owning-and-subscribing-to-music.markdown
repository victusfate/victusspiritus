  content: "Let me start by mentioning the image and it saying 'Free,' unless someone
    else were to bring it up. Yes, I was using the free version at the point in time
    I took the screencap; I've since upgraded and that list is still grayed out.\n\nI'm
    pretty firmly set in my ways of owning the tracks, which leaves most\n web services
    up to the task of introducing me to new stuff, or as an \non-demand track provider.
    \n\nI haven't quite figured out if Spotify Premium is worth it for me, yet. I
    don't have any mobile devices, so the caching of tracks and mobile support is
    lost on me. The only real feature that's getting paid for is exclusivity. A service
    with a browser-based client, such as rdio, would probably be a better deal for
    me.\n\nI've also previously written about my multiple losses to DRM based caches
    and why I'm not all that interested in the cloud, particularly music in the cloud.

<h2>Paths to experiencing music</h2>
<p>My music listening habits center about work, exercise and travel with Drum and Bass taking over as my recent favorite category. I enjoy the hell out of discovery through music services like Pandora, but when a song clicks I feel an immediate compulsion to own it free of DRM.</p>
<p>The main purpose for doing so is that music subscription services come and go, and they don't necessarily have to be on my chosen platform of the day. I also like being able to share music freely with friends, in hopes of sparking new (paying?) fans.</p>
<h2>DRM Music Subscription</h2>
<p>Yesterday I signed up for Spotify, a music subscription service via <a href="http://blog.louisgray.com/2011/07/spotifys-us-launch-goes-smoothly-music.html?m=1">Louis Gray's</a> open invite to review the state of DRM music. The selection of music is quite broad but it would be little use to me while out walking and without net access. I quickly upgraded to a premium membership to be able to cache songs on my mobile devices for offline mode, but I have a couple of problems with paying for access to DRM music:  </p>
<ol>
<li>There are lingering access rights issues for US accounts<br />
Another recent subscriber <a href="https://plus.google.com/102261077460248688577/posts/hEgPB8VzMFx?hl=en">James Fuller</a> had issues getting access to songs that Louis shared out.<br />
<a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/sad-lg.png"><img src="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/sad-lg.png" alt="" title="sad-lg" width="512" height="502" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9715" /></a>
</li>
<li>If you like being social with your music tastes, subscription only works if you and your friends all have access to the same collection. If I'm on Spotify and you're on Rhapsody we may not be able to exchange our favorite tracks.</li>
<li>The price point of $10/month for add free listening is much higher than my Pandora subscription $3/month. I'm quite happy with Pandora but it doesn't have a play offline mode. Is it worth $7/month to be able to cache songs that I still don't own?</li>
<li>A significant fraction of fantastic music I come across is local or not "big enough" to be on large subscription services like Spotify and Rhapsody. Paying these services doesn't help me share sounds with friends, but services like <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com">SoundCloud</a> do.

</li>
</ol>
<p>When you own a song you have the ability to listen to it in the far future. Your rights extend beyond dependency on particular provider companies and instead rely on digital formats (mp3). In addition you can share a song with a friend in order to turn them on to a new sound or artist, which is often not possible with restricted digital rights managed music formats.</p>
