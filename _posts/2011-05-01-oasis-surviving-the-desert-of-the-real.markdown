    Nice. Here are two related quotes:

    From Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility: "In seasons of cheerfulness, no temper could be more cheerful than hers, or possess, in a greater degree, that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness itself."

    And from Khalil Gibran's The Pophet: "For what are your possessions but things you keep and guard for fear you may need them to morrow? And to-morrow, what shall to-morrow bring to the ovcr-prudent dog burying bones in the trackless sand as he follows the pilgrims to the holy city? And what is fear of need but need itself? Is not dread of thirst when your well is full, the thirst that is unquenchable?"

    Money for the sake of doing things with it is a blessing. Money for its own sake is a curse.

<p>(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEYHQ9dscY#t=02m17s">incredible line</a>)<br />
Enjoy this fortune cookie Sunday post.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Nomad, you've been wandering the desert for decades, what is your secret? </p>
<p>The nomad responds,<br />
"You expect water?</p>
<p>Predict its coming,<br />
Understand its flow, and always<br />
Know that which you seek.</p>
<p>No, it's not water which I'm after. If it were I would have left the desert long ago. </p>
<p>What I seek is Thirst."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every time I think I know exactly what I want, immediately something else bubbles up beneath the surface that I value far more. The common theme is freedom. The thinking goes, earn enough wealth, and you will be free. And yet...</p>
<h2>money cannot purchase freedom from pursuing it</h2>
<p>We all share a persistent search for purpose. Only through meaning, may we experience satisfaction in our life and labor. A moment of contemplation makes vividly clear the distinction between the pursuit of wealth, and directly nourishing that which we need, liberty. </p>
<p>After walking enough connected mazes the importance of this point is painfully clear. If we're unaware of the distinction between where our current path leads and where we truly wish to be, we are destined to wander without end. We have only one life to distinguish between that which is our water or our thirst, so it's critical we make efficient use of that dwindling resource.   </p>
<h2>An inner compass is our truest guide</h2>
<p>You shouldn't accept anything I preach at face value, but I hope you hear my thoughts. I'm wise enough to know how foolish I am. A reminder of caution: be wary of anyone who exudes endless confidence, they're the most likely to lead you off a cliff.</p>
