  content: "Depending, Mark, upon whether or not your back pain has originated from
    spending toooooooo much contiguous time curled up before your laptop/pc/workstation/whatever
    in the process of pushing out steady streams of code or excessive blogging or
    some other activity all related to using your workstation, then I can certainly
    relate. If the origin is something else, well then perhaps not.\n\nI find that
    I can get so immersed in what I am doing that time slips by and I am quite oblivious
    to everything unless there is some external interruptive signal such as the phone
    ringing. I also love to sit cross-legged on my chair while so immersed. \n\nMy
    wife/biz partner tells me that it is often quite funny to see me attempt to stand
    after being in this position for a while. And the pain between the shoulder-blades
    is something special. So now I have resorted to taking chondroitin and the occasional
    Aleve (disclaimer: I'm not offering medical advice; merely reporting what I have
    done to help myself) and otherwise just keep going as best as I can.\n\nHowever,
    I am also constantly reminded about keeping a balance in my life: That really
    is the greatest advice and remedy but easier said than done as I'm sure you also
    have found out.\n\nIt is reputed that the great chellist, Pablo Casals, has suffered
    greatly from rheumatoid arthritis  such that his fingers have been seized up in
    the morning yet once he started playing his chello, they gradually became free
    enough for him top play as well as he ever did. Not suggesting you have arthritis
    but I do find it interesting that we can overcome pain and restrictions when we
    ar doing the things we truly enjoy and love."

  content: Thanks for the generous wisdom from your first hand experience. I to fall
    into a flow like disconnect from time when I'm busy working, and I try to balance
    that with a love for walking/hiking (70-80 miles per week). I think it may be
    muscle spasm, or something pulled.

  content: 70-80 miles is quite a good distance to walk on a weekly basis. I am very
    impressed. By all accounts, walking is a very good exercise not only physically
    but mentally so you must be doing something right. I attempt 3 miles or 40 minutes
    a day now but recently the weather here in North County San Diego has been really
    hot even very early in the morning so it is not much fun and I've slipped in my
    commitment.  More than likley then, it is just a pulled muscle and rest shold
    help with that.

<p>Most programmer types think that as long as their head and their hands are functioning they can crank out code. The past couple weeks have <I>educated</I> me that there is at least one other malady that can lay the most enthusiastic coder (without a laptop) low, and that devil is lower back pain. </p>
<p>I can't sit down. Well, I can but it hurts like hell. The act of going from sitting to standing is excruciating. Getting out of bed each morning must look like a bionic man slo-mo or bullet time from the matrix to my wife. I feel about twice my age while moving about, each action is measured. I don't move from a current satisfactory position unless the need is great. </p>
<p>After my lower back started aching two weeks ago, I went to see my doctor. He prescribed muscle relaxants and pain killers. I've used the muscle relaxants at night because they make me drowsy, and they seem to help me sleep comfortably. </p>
<p><I>I can't relax, even on a couch</I><br />
The problem is I can't sit down and get any substantial development work done. It was a tremendous effort just getting node.js, connect, express and geo-couchdb installed over the last couple of days. Getting those tools setup is normally pretty trivial, but with an undercurrent of back pain, even the mundane becomes a trial. </p>
<p>The good news, with Tyler's help I think I got through the setup phase last night and I might get a chance to learn a little more about Erlang, the language couchdb is developed in. Later after the Cheeseburger Summit in Manhattan today, I can begin tweaking the interface. The cheeseburger lunch is a meetup I was introduced to by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/falicon">Kevin Marshall</a>, he who has mastered the one day hack. Looking forward to catching up with Kevin, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dpinsen">Dave Pinsen</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/orian">Orian Marx</a>, and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/scotterc">Scott C</a>. I'm not thrilled to think about the train ride in. I'll sit a little then stand the rest of the way in.</p>
