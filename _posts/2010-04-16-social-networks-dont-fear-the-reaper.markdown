  content: Hi Mark<br><br>..love the song choice btw. Helped my morning along.<br><br>I
    agree completely that an open interconnected web with our own URL in the center,
    matrixed through our world of friends and networks is the ideal.<br><br>So, the
    practical marketer and market builder comments...sure you are right but you and
    everyone has many audiences and something to say. Aren&#39;t you bringing your
    thinking to your Twitter network, your FB network of friends and on and on.<br><br>Cutting
    the cord from communications channels because philosophically they are within
    your belief structure is noble....but I question the goal...which is communicating
    and if your message has value (which it does) you need to bring it to your audiences
    until you tip the scales and they come to you.

  content: Thank you Arnold, appreciate your well though perspective. I suspect  <br>that
    I have to push myself to creating more distributed alternatives.  <br>As long
    as I keep feeding another network, my own interests fade, my  <br>own passion
    to introduce more options withers.<br><br>We&#39;ll see how long I can hold my
    breath :). I worry the issue that  <br>troubles me is systemic to many aspects
    of the current social web.  <br>Even Disqus is a funnel and jump through someone
    elses hoops. But as  <br>long as I can opt out at any time (full data portability)
    I feel it&#39;s  <br>a fair exchange. I can&#39;t even find my tweets from 8 days
    ago, unless I  <br>knock on the library of congresses doors. Networks shouldn&#39;t
    act as  <br>owners and gatekeepers to collective data. They should take on the  <br>role
    of protectors but always enable full and simple portability.

  content: At my core Mark, I completely agree with you.<br><br>Maybe the difference
    in our perspectives come from the simple fact that your ideas are part of your
    discovery process for the product your start-up is building. That is you are building
    (I think) something that will create a new way to navigate and use the nodes of
    the web. I can&#39;t wait to use this myself!<br><br>I have a project that is
    about to start moving forward, but I&#39;m mostly about communications channels...thinking
    and writing and helping folks realize their business goals on the social web.
    I want to bring those messages to folks where they are. That not only broadens
    my network but broadens my perspective.<br><br>Am I off base with this?

  content: 'Of course you&#39;re not off base. You are far more considerate of those  <br>that
    benefit from your expertise. I news to get my head around the  <br>ramifications
    of constraints on future communication channels. Have  <br>you considered the
    fact that your fans (myself included) may benefit  <br>from alternative formats
    more than we do from following you on say  <br>twitter? Even at my pruned 60 or
    so follow level, I miss opportunities  <br>to engage with content you share. There&#39;s
    too many folks trying to  <br>cram everything in to many 140 character updates.
    I admire the  <br>fluidity but I would appreciate the ability to code up my own  <br>extensions
    in a ways that others who use the same network can benefit  <br>from. The companies
    hold the keys to formats, not the community. At  <br>least in the most popular
    soc networks. I get the feeling I&#39;m playing  <br>into an elaborate mouse trap
    when I push againt the boundaries, whenI  <br>rattle the cage. It&#39;s not all
    bad, these companies are hinting at  <br>what&#39;s possible if we embrace serendipity
    and collaborative  <br>communication.<br><br>As to the project: it should mirror
    a wordpress approach to social web  <br>browsing/writing. We&#39;re purposefully
    doing our best to keep it lean.  <br>In order to test out some of the technology
    Tyler has used it in a  <br>ruby open source implementation. It can play well
    with identi.ca and  <br>buzz at the moment. If web finger catches on it&#39;ll
    work with much more  <br>without specialization to a service.<br><br>Hoping I
    don&#39;t do a disservice to the front end design or game  <br>mechanics that&#39;ll
    promote tagging/connectivity between updates.<br><br><br><br>My soapbox<br>Http://www.victusspiritus.com/'

<h2>Why I'm Opting out of Centralized Social Networks</h2>
<p>As far as I can tell centralized social networks are redundant, and about as un-web like as you can get. The comparisons of Facebook and even Twitter to AOL are not unfounded. We yield far too much control to third party corporations by constraining how we communicate over the Net. We have blogs to capture and share our thoughts on diverse topics with varying complexity. There are numerous free blogging platforms, and free software for self hosted solutions. But this format is perceived as too heavy for short single messages, and thus microblogging emerged as a socially accepted pattern. </p>
<p>A URL can point to all social interactions, videos, songs, and Net data we desire. This URL doesn't have to point to stream data that resides in a company database, behind a paywall (this includes blog platforms that don't enable default, easy read/write access). The moment we make this Faustian bargain we hand over value and more importantly control to an external entity that may not share our best interests.  Distributed solutions to social sharing these streams is growing at an exponential pace. This model does mimick features of the p2p content sharing system.</p>
<p>Microblogging is hot as a marketing engine and a quick browsing interface to longer form content. Twitter is the most popular social browser outside of Facebook but both of these type of networks are redundant once users become familiar with alternatives. Open options have failed to be competitive because of marketing, ease of use, and the requirement for new standards (or implementation of old ones). A general purpose browser can render URLs, which can correspond to people streams, object statuses, or whatever we can imagine at that URL.  Social browsers need not be locked away in a corporate database or handed out piece meal with rigid or lacking formats. Corporate and open source tools compete to manage feed following and remixing/curation. You can count on the leading social browsing tool organizations to embrace the distributed nature of the web and Internet, where everyone and no one owns all the data. Financial models which support this format is where we have to push our creativity.</p>
