    Hey Victus,

    I agree with your general direction here, but it's not yet clear where the major opportunity lies.  Is it a new type of browser that really bends websites to its users' will?  I've often thought of this idea as "middleware for the web".

    On the Rapportive front, stay tuned: there's lots of awesome stuff coming :)

    Best,
    Rahul, CEO of Rapportive

  content: Oh hey, thanks for stopping by.Many of my blog posts aren't created with
    an immediate monetization angle. They're just a snapshot of a need as I dump my
    mind's cache that morning to focus on my present responsibilities.The personalized
    view window has been a recent desire of mine, and most browsers allow me to tweak
    CSS on page and see the result. They just don't remember my changes.Looking forward
    to Rapportive's rapid intelligence mission. Many folks live in their inboxes so
    any way to minimize that, or make it more efficient is appreciated. Hope all is
    going well for you and the Rapportive team.

<p>*update*<br />
I found some old browser extensions that enable memory of customized css for pages you visit. Stylish for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108/">Firefox</a>.</p>
<p><I>Redesign Your Favorite Sites</i></p>
<p>While checking into gmail and twitter yesterday morning I craved nothing more than a complete overhaul to their user interfaces. While these services hold the keys to my data, they've done an inadequate job of empowering each user to customize the way they observe and use it. I'm pseudo comfortable with these companies having access to my data, although I'd prefer to replicate important info to multiple servers under my control. Regardless of who has a copy of data we create or interact with, choosing how we see it is entirely up to us.</p>
<p>There's no need for fancy authentication or separate applications to modify the views to these sites. Modifying views within a browser is as easy as a few custom lines of JavaScript, jQuery, or CSS but most folks aren't comfortable with editing code. The solution is obvious, a true read write web interface. A visual site crafting tool is something I want and can build.</p>
<p><i>The idea of customized interfaces isn't novel</I></p>
<p>Several companies are pursuing adjacent products. Visual portals constructed by users in the vein of iGoogle, <a href="http://netvibes.com">Netvibes</a> and now <a href="http://www.wozaik.com/welcome">Wozaik</a> are a step in the right direction but are tuned towards guiding users through their sites. I don't want to go through an intermediary to see my Twitter variant. I'd like to visit Twitter.com and have a malleable design that remembers how I last left it. There could be many variants of site views enabling me to select one that best suits my purpose. Instead of clipping pieces of web sites and pasting them into multiple portals, I'd prefer to modify the appearance of existing sites, and have the browser remember the customizations whenever I visit them. </p>
<p><I>Suggested Implementation</i></p>
<p>My instinct is to go with javascript that is aware of a browser's mouse and or touch interface. The memory of newly modified JavaScript/CSS/HTML can be accessed through browser addons, and synchronized between browsers so designs could be customized once and browsed anywhere. An option to see the native site design would always be available as well as a history of changes. There is a market opportunity here to encourage more active interface crafters, and enable them to easily share and sell their designs.</p>
<p><I>Elegant Example of Repurposing Space</I></p>
<p>A great example of reconfiguring space is <a href="http://www.rapportive.com">Rapportive's</a> repurposing of ad space in gmail for aggregated information about a contact. Hold on a second, isn't Google losing ad revenue by giving up this space? There are new avenues of monetization with companies like Rapportive and LinkedIn, to create more client value and revenue from the space. It's up to these companies to navigate a solution that benefits all parties. As a gmail user for 5-6 years I admit to never clicking an ad within the interface, although I've clicked through many Rapportive informational links in just a couple of months.<br />
