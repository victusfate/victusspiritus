  content: "Pretty amazing graphics accompanying this blog Mark: I mean both the first
    and the last.\n\nThe first because it rather reminds me of what we used to call
    \"The Tractor Shed\", a very old 2-story building that included the Dairy at one
    end where the portable vessels used in milking each of the cows in the Milking
    Parlour where emptied via coolers into the large Milk Churns. To the side was
    room for 2 tractors and a workshop and above was a small store area. Since the
    farm into dated back - by today's date - around 500 years ago, it was in need
    of some real TLC but these are wonderful memories I have of my time spent there
    when I had the opportunity many years ago now.\n\nThe last graphic because it
    shows in incredible detail just how things have really changed in a much shorter
    period than 500 years yet, in so many analogous ways, our economy has decayed
    almost as much as the old farm shown in the first graphic. \n\nReally emphasizes
    the old adage that \"a picture is worth a thousand words!\" while your own words
    in this blog sum up the changes quite succinctly. Good job well done. Thank you."

  content: "I learn a little with every post, more so from the comments. I'll have
    to revisit that image again through different eyes. \r\n\r\nAs to our economy,
    well that's just a challenge we have to face and make the best of. It begins by
    getting in touch with what really matters. Our materialistic distraction era is
    coming to close."

  content: It's been a while since I've done any digital circuit designs, most of
    my grad classes were systems, network and signal analysis. I used to get down
    and funky with CAD, J/K dual flip flops, and Op Amporama, but those days are long
    behind me. Now I play with programs to process data.

  content: "Mark: No worries about however long ago it was when you last worked with
    digital systems design.\nDave: To understand the origin of your question is intriguing\n\nWhile
    also having a degree in electrical/electronics engineering  which got me my first
    not-self-employed job as a Process Instrumentation Engineer in the UK with a subsidiary
    of an American company where my work was focused upon designing systems for furnace
    control, I think I can safely suggest that even understanding digital circuit
    design would not be sufficient to design a complete Air Conditioner system. {grin}
    \n\nNonetheless, I am intrigued enough by Dave's request - just out of curiosity
    - to add that I would love to learn more about what is behind the request."

    the talents of engineers (Scott also comes to mind) get diverted into web apps
    and such. The world needs tangible products too, and it would help our economy
    to make more of them here. \n\nBut you have to follow your passion. \n\nAny luck

    Not yet.

    When it comes to fund raising, every successful round follows product proof. We have to build and prove utility/adoption first.

<p><em>Internalize Radical Economic and Social Change</em></p>
<p>The American economy has shifted over time from agricultural, to industrial, to post-industrial. These changes resemble slow drifting tectonic plates (macro trends), but are scarred by periodic spikes that become massive mountains and deep ocean rifts of economic and social upheaval. The labor skills in greatest demand have changed drastically, leaving large segments of society without jobs that draw out their greatest gifts. It's incredibly hard for folks who've spent their lives mastering specific challenges to relearn a new high demand trade, but survival is an unmatched motivator. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/aa-jobless-men-keep-going-from-Depression-good-one.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5134" title="aa-jobless-men-keep-going-from-Depression-good-one" src="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/aa-jobless-men-keep-going-from-Depression-good-one.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p>I've gone through a drastic change in applied skills over the past year. My background in science* has undergone a metamorphosis into new skills in web publishing, marketing, and web application development. I chose to do this because of my enthusiasm for open information exchange, and an unquenchable desire to find untapped value in open data. In contrast, collaboration is a four letter word in many shrinking markets. I haven't finished crossing the chasm professionally, but at least I can see a ray of hope. I'm now able to rapidly understand and help build interactive web applications with my new skills. <em>Growing</em> an application of significant social value is one of my driving goals. My professional life mirrors some of the macro changes within the US economy, as many larger industrial era businesses are forced to shrink and embrace the network economy.</p>
<p><em>Pseudo Capitalism</em></p>
<p>Our nation is founded on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire#United_States">economic principles</a> which foster competitive change without heavy intervention from the government. The competition for market domination by businesses, mimics natural competition for limited resources. Like nature, markets evolve over time giving way to disruptive forces.</p>
<p>The most powerful counter force to full commoditization of labor is worker mobility^. Businesses compete for the most capable employees by offering inspiring corporate culture, partial ownership (equity), salaries that remove financial friction, and generous benefits. A direct connection between worker effort and observing the effect of their labor on the bottom line, is key to business success. Top down hierarchies suffer from a lack of push back on assumptions. The more empowered each employee is, the faster the business can adapt to opportunities in a shifting market. </p>
<p>There's a powerful connection from government capital to social/infrastructure investment. American capitalism drifted over time to mix in strong government influence over finance:</p>
<ul>
<li>tariffs</li>
<li>taxes</li>
<li>Federal Banks</li>
<li>heavy financial legislation</li>
</ul>
<p>Federal, state, and local government spending supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>education</li>
<li>government employees</li>
<li>infrastructure &amp; social programs</li>
<li>defense industry</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll leave off this riff with a great historic image of the US economy from the 1920s to 2008.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Big_US_history_goodSheet_006_Economy.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5136   aligncenter" title="Big_US_history_goodSheet_006_Economy" src="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Big_US_history_goodSheet_006_Economy.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="262" /></a>This timeline come's from <a href="http://www.good.is/post/good-sheet-its-the-economy-stupid">GOOD</a> (Oct, 2008)</p>
<p>Notes:<br />
* = My education is in physics (BS) and engineering (MSEE) followed by fourteen years of simulations and algorithm development.</p>
<p>^= "The most powerful counter force to full commoditization of labor is worker mobility". This mirrors the most potent counter force to full centralized control of the social web, data and service mobility.</p>
