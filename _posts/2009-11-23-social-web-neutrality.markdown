  content: Mark, interesting read.<br><br>Since the Salesforce chatter announcement,
    <a href="http://bit.ly/7jmNmI" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/7jmNmI</a>, I&#39;ve
    been thinking about how social media really needs to move inside of the enterprise
    but by all definitions of the enterprise today, just can&#39;t without a negative
    transformation.<br><br>Nothing net neutral about a controlled environment where
    APIs parse input from Facebook and Twitter and shovel them into another corporately
    governed social camp.<br><br>This is one of the next frontiers. Any ideas on how
    this would look from an infrastructure perspective?

  content: Well folks much smarter than myself came together and put together an <a
    href="http://www.opensocial.org/" rel="nofollow">open social protocol</a> not
    too long ago. I don&#39;t think it has gained major steam but it&#39;s still out
    there, and several services support it. The main ideas were portability and open
    design in social media.<br><br>With real time RSS from pubsubhubbub and RSSCloud,
    blogs are open social architectures. And the comment aggregators Disqus and Js-kit
    Echo are data portable (we can pull our comments out of their systems any time).

  content: Controlled environments generally are a product of fear and it is fear
    which we sometimes overlook in the speed of technology development.   We don&#39;t
    think we have time to contemplate consequences and take the time to appreciate
    the effect on the total system.<br><br>The idea of openness is something that
    the social media plane provider obviously grasp (open social and application protocol&#39;s
    exist, cloud computing apps exist because this deep innovative potential now clearly
    exists).  My concern is the high-flyer plane providers and pilots are travelling
    at a breath-taking speed compared to slower plodding social media passengers,
    for passengers usually grasp opportunity at a surface layer, when the real opportunity
    for social media is in depth between the cloud and human reality and not just
    in the cloud.<br><br>The passengers of social media have the platform created
    for them, get a free ticket if not a free social media ride and the passenger
    of this flight into the new simply learns to buckle up and then maybe learn how
    become a great follower, which in turn means that the mirror neuron must surely
    exist for this followership is one kind (not the only kind) of learning.   This
    behaviour pattern lies at the heart of social aggregation and the value of the
    network is consequently scored by size of community body but not as much depth
    of individual mind.<br><br>The idea of the social media passenger fits neatly
    with Guy Debord&#39;s conception of the "spectacle" or spectator.  It also fits
    with Marshall McLuhan&#39;s view of systems being extensions of the nervous system.  The
    question at the enterprise level therefore IMHO is how does one motivate social
    media passengers to become social media travellers?<br><br>The enterprise and
    social media relationship is not a chicken and egg situation, it is not a Wright
    Brother problem either.  It is a great moment when human beings learn to fly in
    any walk of life and social media is no different.  The physical flying experience
    is bereft with problems because airports in the modern age have become even more
    controlled environments, the joy the Wright Brothers had regarding the discover
    of human flight, isn&#39;t the joy a modern passenger feel, for they continue
    to simply be cogs in a flying system.  <br><br>So fear is what keeps people being
    social media passengers, but to become social media travellers, it requires a
    different relationship between social media plane providers and pilots, and how
    this can translate to the generation of high-flying enterprise capability.  So
    it is fear and not the "enterprise" which is the chief transformation point in
    human experience.  Attack is not synonymous with fearless beings, when we attack
    anything we do so because we emanate from a place or state of fear ourselves.  We
    then don&#39;t enjoy difference, we fear it.<br><br>How do we get social media
    passengers see that they can fly in the social media space?   Such "flying" ability
    is the real transformation point of both social media and enterprise, especially
    when the passenger of social media does not notice the plane.  At that point social
    media travellers are born, freedom is realized and this is nothing new, from scientific
    observation to biblical interpretations, fear has yet to be conquered, even as
    we marvel at technology, we are still flummoxed by the power emanating from pea-brain
    sized amygdala.<br><br>Social media providers and/or pilots need to pay as much
    attention to long-term destinations as they do to plane design as well as hub
    and spoke infrastructure.  A passenger is simply a tourist, but there is a huge
    difference between a tourist that exists as an extension of social media and a
    traveller who takes social media as a given reality and becomes emergent and conscious
    of greater opportunties.  <br><br>That consciousness is an awakening, and such
    an awakening is that the issues of enterprise are also the issues of social media,
    it is more of a question of how it is we learn to see, especially if we are no
    longer focusing on just our singular part of the total being.  If fear is the
    mechanical misfit that disrupts the biology of any living system, then we are
    not creating a new form of humanity but human beings being taught to operate in
    a different kind of mechanical system, and there in lies the most basic relationship
    opportunity that equates social media and enterprise, to utilize this new resource
    to create neural confidence to enable this new reality.<br><br>[Em]

    comment. It&#39;s rare that a post of mine recieves a comment of greater length
    and depth :). I&#39;m humbled by it.<br><br>Your passenger/social media analogy

    fear has had on joyous human experiences.

  content: Emergence matters to me not because it is a property of nature but because
    human&#39;s have the capacity to think.  So depth for me begins with getting beyond
    the first page and how we also find value in any given paragraph of human thinking
    that surprises us.<br><br>When I hit the link to Kevin Kelly, I was awashed in
    an ocean of information food from a man who has gone beyond the first book (never
    mind the first paragraph or page!) and whose life decisions have accumulated a
    rich nutritious specialism that defines Kelly who has reached the nirvana of depth
    - a life in flow.<br><br>How did I go beyond the first page once I arrived at
    Kevin Kelly&#39;s page?  I simply scanned for anything that has the highest personal
    resonance to my own life.  That wasn&#39;t hard to find which is Kelly&#39;s treatise
    on the scientific method:<br><br><a href="http://fora.tv/2006/03/10/Next_100_Years_of_Science"
    rel="nofollow">http://fora.tv/2006/03/10/Next_100_Years_of_Sci...</a><br><br>That
    is what I mean by "depth".  It is a personal discovery, and why I consider following
    "size" not depth.  Until I see a valid purpose for accumulating "size" for my
    own life, I will prefer to pursue "depth".  Depth he does not mean "a deep thinker"
    but the discovery of thinking that is relevant to one&#39;s own being.<br><br>Fear
    as a human mechanism is meant to help us but the kind of fear that I refer to
    is linked to our ancestral past, a DNA linked to life experiences that even a
    caveman could relate to.  To understand fear in the modern context is to appreciate
    its opportunity, and this opportunity is evaporating the illusion of fear so we
    free joy and access new life energy - and also realizing where fear is helpful
    i.e. as a caring and protective intelligence.<br><br>The question then becomes
    how does "fear" affect our "follower behaviour" (our "need" to live with size)
    and how does it release and renew our own capacities and freedom to think (to
    establish depth that may even question the need for size).<br><br>My twitter usage
    is therefore based on depth rather than size (and there is nothing wrong with
    accumulating size, if it serves purpose - and in my own particular case size does
    not serve me at all).  <br><br>This depth has an "emergence" that the pursuit
    for size IMHO does not, for the pursuit of size is IMHO a dependency not a personal
    freedom.  When we therefore add depth as a perspective along with the common perspective
    regarding size, the combined choice produces breadth.  I do not know my breadth
    yet because I have not begun appreciating depth but this is what I am pursuing
    now.<br><br>By hearing what Kevin Kelly thinks about science in the Fora.TV presentation
    link above, it arrives at a time when I have also begun to open the book on who
    Descartes was (something I have recently decided).  I am not a follower of Descartes
    but there is something to his "Discourse on Method" and "Rules for the Direction
    of the Mind" - that prompts me to pursue another aspect of depth - not to become
    a know-it-all, but to simply appreciate new layers of human experience.  I am
    new to the scientific method, therefore I found this strand of value in the rich
    field of knowledge that Kevin Kelly provides - and by pursuing these single strands
    I benefit from depth, rather than get irrevocably lost in his breadth.<br><br>This
    depth then is at best a form of emergence, but it can easily be a pathway into
    the information swamp.  The joy for me is in the simple sum of discoveries that
    hopefully add up to a series of experiences that fundamentally shift or lift my
    own thinking.<br><br>There is nothing more awful for me than for others to follow
    my thinking, when IMHO they have the opportunity to discover their own path and
    way, which is as divergent as human experience can possibly be.  The former is
    an act of "size", the latter is an act of "depth".<br><br>Mark, what I have learned
    about Descartes (again for my personal relevance) is how much importance he attached
    to method rather than ad hoc behaviour.  So now I am going to miss a sports event
    and substitute my attention to Kevin Kelly presentation - for if one pursue&#39;s
    depth, these golden nuggets become fruit rather than metal - and what is one of
    the great aspects of joy itself, but go forth and multiply - and this joy is a
    highly personal experience, a life decision that is an individual discovery.<br><br>[Em]

  content: I&#39;m very glad Kevin&#39;s work resonated with you. I had hoped it would,
    and I see you have experienced it in a completely novel way compared to my experiences
    with reading his work. It&#39;s been a long time (18 years) since I&#39;ve read
    Descartes in my freshmen year of college. <br><br>I had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes#Philosophical_work"
    rel="nofollow">to review his work at wikipedia</a> to refresh my memory. What
    a joy it is re-experiencing his philosophy and feeling a powerful resonance with
    my own thinking.

  content: I think the primary "novelty" is that one is absorbed in a particular discipline,
    one ceases to see it from the outside.  When one is absorbed in one&#39;s work,
    one cannot imagine what we look like when someone passes by on the street, who
    may see us through a window busy with our thinking.<br><br>I watched the latest
    rendition of the Prisoner (which originally featured Patrick McGoohan), and I
    also watch movies like the Matrix and therefore am very cogent that I don&#39;t
    want to be sitting on the inside of things.  This attitude is supported by my
    high regard for the Founding Fathers of the US, the difference between men who
    risked their lives for freedom and those who grew the system into new empires.  <br><br>Right
    now I am reading "Tom Sorrell" Descartes - A Very Short Introduction.  This is
    the way I am easing into the huge breadth and information footprint that Descartes
    left behind.  I think that Sorrell has done a great job of "introducing" Descartes
    the man.<br><br>For sure, the moment I first saw Kevin Kelly&#39;s page, I simply
    sat back and thought WOW! but how do I eat this :-)<br><br>That answer is simple,
    through the knife and fork of my own life goals and the emergent reality that
    emanates as my own way of discovery sits both in parallel and paradox to this.  In
    that regard I welcome the humanity of the network (because it is an extension
    of my own consciousness) but I am rather guarded about networked humanity because
    again - it is easy to lose sight of our life goals because we stood in a forest
    of information overload.  That is why I also associate the word "Cloud" with flying
    i.e. The Provider, The Pilot and the Passenger.   Which brings me back to Sorrell&#39;s
    book who talks about the quadrivium - arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music.  Oh
    yes music:<br><br>In that regard Tom Petty sums up my present state so well:<br><br><a

    Re: KEVIN KELLY</b></u><br><br>Having listened to the Kevin Kelly fora.tv (<a

    first to existing material that I have paid attention to i.e. Steven Baker talking
    about the rise of the Numerati:<br><br><a href="http://thenumerati.net/" rel="nofollow">http://thenumerati.net/</a><br><br>and
    also many years ago I came across Michael Schrage writing about "Serious Play",

    a linking point rather than perspective point here), here it reminds me also about
    McLuhan&#39;s refrain "The Medium is the Message" because as Kelly points out

    ways, especially enabled by new medium&#39;s such as modern technology :<br><br><a

  content: Qualche settimana fa, dall'Agcom, si sollevò l'ancora molto sottovalutata
    e poco conosciuta questione della cosiddetta "net neutrality" e si palesò il malcontento
    crescente delle aziende che forniscono le connessioni al we
---
<p>Since the spot light is on net neutrality and potential government regulation, I considered the analogous developing social web. I suspect my friend and facebook guru <a HREF="http://staynalive.com/">Jesse Stay</a> may not agree. My premise, If I introduced two people, I don't own that relationship, so why should a social site? </p>
<h2>It Begins With Net Neutrality</h2>
<p>The Internet and Web are founded on open architectures. As long as your data satisfies the protocol any linked systems can access your data. </p>
<p>The connectivity of the Internet has evolved in stages. Early phone lines of varying bandwidth were followed by cable and wireless providers. We've taken our net connections from work, school, home, and now mobile. (<a HREF="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2009/07/14/peer-to-peer-parallel-networking-for-your-iphone/">here's some collected background info on protocols</a>).  </p>
<p>The strength of the net is that judgement of data is withheld. I'm free to create and share any data or software I wish as long as I follow the protocol, and respect media ownership (this is a changing ruleset). Ideally, the businesses and governments which provide the pipes are NOT supposed to regulate the data that goes through the network. But a conflict of interest has risen for many large teleco providers as well as nearly all nations (who wish to restrict access) who block or artificially limit access. I suspect a similar conflict is happening within large social sites.</p>
<p>Ultimately new net based business, and business growth is fueled by access to wider bandwidth. This paid for access will have no constraints on how businesses and individuals use their access. This is the holy grail of dumb pipes (they don't control what goes through the netwok).</p>
<h2>The Rise of Social Media</h2>
<p>Not too far back, specialized web spaces were created to empower individuals with the ability to self publish dynamic information. Beyond this assisted publishing, average folks were able create virtual connections to old and new friends. This additional social channel interest summoned (can user need summon products?) a series of social web serviced. </p>
<p>From crowd sourced search and filtering (Digg, Stumble Upon, Hacker News, Reddit), to shared media (YouTube, blip.tv, Pandora, Last.fm) a huge variety of social sites have sprung to life on the net. Meanwhile battles raged over content ownership in an attempt to restrict social sharing. It became all to easy to email your favorite song or book to dozens of friends. Old distribution channels were being bypassed entirely. And yet, devoted fans still purchase the media they wish to support. The price structure has changed drastically from the media substrate (8tracks, cassettes, CDs, DVDs) to the value of the content. </p>
<p>But sites and services weren't enough. We wanted to used these new social functions in our own way. SaaS (software as a service) and APIs allowed web businesses to discover new markets by opening design to users. This fostered creation of new business ecosystems, a pretty amazing dynamic of net business.</p>
<h2>Why isn't the net social neutral?</h2>
<p>Many of the services on the web are landing pages, or dead ends. If I can't easily transfer out my social network and information (data!) to other networks, the social site has restricted access. They are no longer a neutral entity. I would argue all current social media sites have redtricted data flow in one way or another. No matter how open a business claims it's site and data to be, they force you to visit and access their site through their portal. </p>
<p>A solution to this lack of data neutrality isn't goverment enforcement. We require a clear separation of what data a user owns, and what data and value the social site owns. The clearer this distinction is, the faster the social web and it's multitude of users can move on to discovering new value. The secret sauce of social is mutual participation, and shared ownership.</p>
<p>Some would argue that services like Twitter and Facebook have advanced APIs which enable remote access. This is a great start, but the true test is when the main sites of social media go down or evaporate, and we are still able to maintain protocol level connectivity to our social graph and use our data. </p>
<p>Distributed protocols and servers, external to the social business will aid in shifting the social net to data neutral.    </p>
