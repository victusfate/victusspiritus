<p>This isn't fantasy football, this is our life savings, our retirements going under.</p>
<p>It's difficult not to be disturbed when our news comedy (The Daily Show) becomes a source of real journalism and information about our (fantasy) financial entertainment (Mad Money). Many of us have invested a large portion of earnings over our careers into 401ks and pension plans.  We're concerned about the forecasts for the American financial future, and some of us are downright angry at the prospect that we were bamboozled. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-49"></a></p>
<p>A few key quotes</p>
<ul>
<li>Stewart:"Now to pretend that this was some sort of crazy once-in-a-lifetime<br />
tsunami that no one could see coming is disingenuous at best and<br />
criminal at worst"</li>
<li>Cramer:"I got a lot of things wrong because I think it was kind of one in a<br />
million shot, but I don't think anyone should be spared in this<br />
environment."</li>
<li>Cramer:"Absolutely, we could do better, absolutely. There's<br />
shenanigans and we should call them out.  Everyone should. I should do a better job at it."</li>
<li>Stewart:"So, maybe we could remove the 'financial expert' and the 'in Cramer we<br />
trust' and start getting back to fundamentals on the reporting, as<br />
well, and I can go back to making fart noises and funny faces"</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some positives we can take away from this. As an investing nation we want better journalism when it comes to <a title="Initial commentary instigated by Stewart vs. Cramer interview" href="http://www.squidoo.com/Financial-Reporting">financial reporting</a>. We want the truth about the companies and brands that we're going to support. As future business owners, responsible company employees, or dedicated free lancers, we never have to be afraid of asking ourselves the question, "Can I do better?"</p>
<p>My two favorite articles on this subject are <a href="http://tbm.thebigmoney.com/articles/impressions/2009/03/13/cramer-vs-stewart">Cramer vs. Stewart The Daily Show showdown was mesmerizing but not quite satisfying</a> by Troy Patterson, and  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/03/13/final-thoughts-on-cramer_n_174836.html">Final Thoughts On Cramer Vs. Stewart</a> by Jason Linkins for Huffington Post for very different reasons.  Troy Patterson's perspective was brilliant and lead me to reading up on Habermas' philosophical theories on capitalism and freedom.  Mr. Patterson cut to the heart of the matter without mincing words.  Jason Linkins came at the interview from another angle.  He built up Jim Cramer's visit as a sort of sacrifice.  One almost felt empathy for Cramer for taking the heat and walking into The Daily Show grinder, but I don't think Cramer's the type of guy to back down from a good face to face.  Jim Cramer's demeanor was apolegitic, I got the sense that he feels responsible (I believe rightly so) for much of the lost wealth of Americans.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">TRANSCRIPT:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Jon Stewart:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> How the hell did we end up here, Mr. Cramer? What happened? </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Jim Cramer</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;">: I don’t know. I don’t know. Big fan of the show. Who’s never said that?<br />
JS: Well, many people. Let me just explain to you very quickly one<br />
thing that is somewhat misinterpreted. This was not directed at you,<br />
per say. I just want you to know that. We threw some banana cream pies<br />
at CNBC. Obviously, you got some schmutz on your jacket from it. Took<br />
exception.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
I think that everyone could come under criticism from it. I mean, we<br />
all should have seen it more. I mean, admittedly this is a terrible<br />
one. Everyone got it wrong. I got a lot of things wrong because I think<br />
it was kind of one in a million shot. But I don’t think anyone should<br />
be spared in this environment.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;">: So, then, if I may, why were you mad at us?<br />
–Audience laughs–<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> No.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> Because I was under the impression that you thought we were being unfair.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
No, you have my friend Joe Nocera on and Joe called me and said, ‘Jim,<br />
do I need to apologize to you?’ and I said, No. We’re fair game. We’re<br />
big network. We’ve been out front. We’ve made mistakes. We have 17<br />
hours of live TV a day to do. But I—<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
Maybe you could cut down on that. –Audience laughs– So let me tell you<br />
why I think this has caused some attention. It’s the gap between what<br />
CNBC advertises itself as and what it is and the help that people need<br />
to discern this. Let me show you…This is the promo for your show.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> Okay.<br />
–”In Cramer We Trust” promo”–<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> Isn’t that, you know, look—we are both snake oil salesmen to a certain extent–<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> I’m not discerning…<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS: </span></strong><span style="color: #000080;">–but<br />
we do label the show as snake oil here. Isn’t there a problem with<br />
selling snake oil and labeling it as vitamin tonic and saying that it<br />
cures impetigo etc. etc. etc. Isn’t that the difficulty here?<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
I think that there are two kids of people. People come out and make<br />
good calls and bad calls that are financial professionals and there are<br />
people who say the only make good calls and they are liars. I try<br />
really hard to make as many good calls as I can.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
I think the difference is not good call/bad call. The difference is<br />
real market and unreal market. Let me show you…This is…you ran a hedge<br />
fund.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> Yes I did.<br />
–December 22, 2006 video of Jim Cramer–<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
You know a lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund and I was<br />
position short, meaning I needed it down, I would create a level of<br />
activity beforehand that could drive the futures. It doesn’t take much<br />
money.<br />
–End Video–<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> What does that mean?<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> Okay, this was a just a hyperbolic example of what people— You had a great piece about short selling earlier.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS: </span></strong><span style="color: #000080;">Yes, I was—<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC: </span></strong><span style="color: #000080;">I<br />
have been trying to reign in short selling, trying to expose what<br />
really happens. This is what goes on, what I’m trying to say is, I<br />
didn’t do this but I’m trying to explain to people this is the<br />
shenanigans that—<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> Well, it sounded as if you were talking about that you had done it.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
Then I was inarticulate because I did– I barely traded the futures. Let<br />
me say this: I am trying to expose this stuff. Exactly what you guys do<br />
and I am trying to get the regulators to look at it. </span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> That’s very interesting because roll 2:10.<br />
–210 video–<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
I would encourage anyone who is in the hedge fund unit ‘do it’ because<br />
it is legal. It is a very quick way to make the money and very<br />
satisfying. By the way, no one else in the world would ever admit that<br />
but I do care.<br />
<strong> Aaron Task:</strong> That’s right and you can say that here.<br />
Unknown: </span><a href="http://www.mahalo.com/answers/money/Inaudible"><span style="color: #000080;">Inaudible</span></a><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #000080;"> means I’m not going to say it on TV.<br />
–End video—<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> It’s on TV now (sheepishly)<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> I want the Jim Cramer on CNBC to protect me from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span> Jim Cramer.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
I think that way you do that is to show—Okay, the regulators watch the<br />
tape, they realize the shenanigans that go on, they can go after this.<br />
Now, they did catch Madoff, that’s a shame.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
Now why when you talk about the regulators, why not the financial news<br />
network? That is the whole point of this? CNBC could be an incredibly<br />
powerful tool of illumination for people that believe that there are<br />
two markets: One that has been sold to us as long term. Put your money<br />
in 401ks. Put your money in pensions and just leave it there. Don’t<br />
worry about it. It’s all doing fine. Then, there’s this other market;<br />
this real market that is occurring in the back room. Where giant piles<br />
of money are going in and out and people are trading them and it’s<br />
transactional and it’s fast. But it’s dangerous, it’s ethically dubious<br />
and it hurts that long term market. So what it feels like to us—and I’m<br />
talking purely as a layman—it feels like we are capitalizing your<br />
adventure by our pension and our hard earned money. And that it is a<br />
game that you know. That you know is going on. But that you go on<br />
television as a financial network and pretend isn’t happening.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
Okay. First, my first reaction is absolutely we could do better.<br />
Absolutely. There’s shenanigans and we should call them out. Everyone<br />
should. I should do a better job at it. But my second thing is, I talk<br />
about the shorts every single night. I got people in Congress who I’ve<br />
been working with trying to get the uptick rule. It’s a technical thing<br />
but it would cut down a lot of the games that you are talking about.<br />
I’m trying. I’m trying. Am I succeeding? I’m trying.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
But the gentleman on that video is a sober rational individual. And the<br />
gentleman on Mad Money is throwing plastic cows through his legs and<br />
shouting “Sell! Sell! Sell!” and then coming on two days later and<br />
going, “I was wrong. You should have bought like–I can’t reconcile the<br />
brilliance and knowledge that you have of the intricacies of the market<br />
with the crazy bull— you do every night. That’s English. That’s<br />
treating people like adults.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> How about if I try it? (contrite)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> Try what?<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> Try doing that. I’ll try that.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS: </span></strong><span style="color: #000080;">That<br />
would be great, but it’s not just you. It’s larger forces at work. It<br />
is this idea that the financial news networks are not just guilty of a<br />
sin of omission but a sin of commission. That they are in bed with<br />
them.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC: </span></strong><span style="color: #000080;">No,<br />
we’re not in bed with them. Come on. I don’t think that’s fair.<br />
Honestly. I think that we try to report the news and I think that<br />
people—<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> A couple of guys do. This guy Faber.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> He’s fabulous, Faber.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> And maybe two other guys (Jim Goldman and Eric Bolling … oops, Eric left CNBC)<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> He’s fabulous and he’s done some things that have really blown the cover off a lot of stuff.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> But this thing was ten years in the making.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> Right.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS: </span></strong><span style="color: #000080;">And<br />
it’s not going to be fixed tomorrow. But the idea that you could have<br />
on the guys from Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch, and guys that had<br />
leveraged 35 to 1…<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> I know.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> And then blame mortgage holders. I mean, that’s insane.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC: </span></strong><span style="color: #000080;">I<br />
never did that. –unintelligible—I’m sorry You’re absolutely right. I<br />
always wish that people would swear themselves in before they came on<br />
the show. I’ve had a lot of CEO’s lie to me on the show. It’s very<br />
painful. I don’t have subpoena power.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> But don’t—You’re pretending that you are a doe-eyed innocent. Watch. Roll. I mean, if I may…<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> It’s your show for Heaven’s sake.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> Roll 2:12.<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> No! Not 2:12! (in sarcastic jest)<br />

</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC: </span></strong><span style="color: #000080;">You can foment. That’s a violation of…<br />
<strong> Aaron Task:</strong> Ferment?<br />
</span> <strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
You can’t FOE-ment. You can’t create yourself, an impression that a<br />
stock’s down, but you do it anyway because the SEC doesn’t understand<br />
it. That’s the only sense that I would say this is illegal…<br />

<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Aaron Task:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> Another stock that you’re focused on right now is Apple (AAPL)<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
Yes, Apple is very important to spread the rumor that both Verizon and<br />
AT&amp;T have decided that they don’t like the phone. That’s a very<br />
easy one to do. You also want to spread the rumor that it is not going<br />
to be ready for MacWorld and this is very easy because the people who<br />
write about Apple want that story and you can claim that it is credible<br />
because you spoke to someone at Apple because Apple is—doesn’t<br />
register.<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Aaron Task:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> Apple doesn’t comment (Apple </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000080;">generally</span></span><span style="color: #000080;"> follows a “no comment” policy to rumors)<br />
–End Video–<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> You know.<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS: </span></strong><span style="color: #000080;">I<br />
gotta tell you. I understand that you want to make finance<br />
entertaining, but it’s not a f—ing game. When I watch that I get, I<br />
can’t tell you how angry it makes me because it says to me, “You all<br />
know.” You all know what’s going on. You can draw a straight line from<br />
those shenanigans to the stuff that was being pulled at Bear and at AIG<br />
and all this derivative market stuff that is this weird Wall Street<br />
side bet.<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
But Jon, don’t you want guys like me that have been in it to show the<br />
shenanigans? What else can I do? I mean, last night’s show—<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
No, no, no, no, no. I want desperately for that, but I feel like that’s<br />
not what we’re getting. What we’re getting is… Listen, you knew what<br />
the banks were doing and yet were touting it for months and months. The<br />
entire network was and so now to pretend that this was some sort of<br />
crazy, once-in-a-lifetime tsunami that nobody could have seen coming is<br />
disingenuous at best and criminal at worst.<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
But Dick Fuld who ran Lehman Brothers, called me in when the stock was<br />
at 40 because I thought that the stock was wrong, I thought that it was<br />
the wrong place for it to be. He brings me in, lies to me, lies to me,<br />
lies to me. I’ve known him for twenty years.<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS: </span></strong><span style="color: #000080;">The CEO of a company lied to you??!! (shock and sarcastic disbelief)<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> Shocker … stop trading (sheepish grin)<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> But isn’t that financial reporting? What do you think is the role of CNBC?<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC: </span></strong><span style="color: #000080;">Look,<br />
I have called for star chambers—I want kangaroo courts for these guys.<br />
I have not seen any indictments. Where are the indictments? Where is<br />
the indictments for AIG? I told the Justice Department, “Here’s the way<br />
you get the indictment.”<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
It’s very easy to get on this after the fact. The measure of the<br />
network, and the measure of mess. CNBC could act as—No one is asking<br />
them to be a regulatory agency, but can’t—but whose side are they on?<br />
It feels like they have to reconcile as their audience the Wall Street<br />
traders that are doing this for constant profit on a day-to-day for<br />
short term. These guys companies were on a Sherman’s March through<br />
their companies financed by our 401ks and all the incentives of their<br />
companies were for short term profit. And they burned the f—ing house<br />
down with our money and walked away rich as hell and you guys knew that<br />
that was going on.<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC: </span></strong><span style="color: #000080;">I<br />
have a wall of shame. Why do I have banana cream pies? Because I throw<br />
them at CEOs. Do you know how many times I have pants CEOs on my show?<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> But this isn’t, as Carly Simon would say, this song ain’t about you.<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
Okay. All right. You’re right. I don’t want to personalize it. I think<br />
we have reporters who try really hard. We’re not always told the truth.<br />
But most importantly, the market was going up for a long time and our<br />
real sin I think was to believe that it was going to continue to go up<br />
a lot in the face of what you just described. A lot of borrowing. A lot<br />
of shenanigans and I know I did, I’ll bring it up, I didn’t think Bear<br />
Sterns was going to evaporate overnight. I didn’t. I knew the people<br />
who ran it, I always thought they were honest. That was my mistake. I<br />
really did. I thought they were honest. Did I get taken in because I<br />
knew them from before? Maybe to some degree. The guy who came on from<br />
Wachovia (new CEO Robert Steele) was an old friend of mine who helped<br />
hire me.<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS: </span></strong><span style="color: #000080;">But honest or not, in what world is a 35 to 1 leverage position sane?<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC: </span></strong><span style="color: #000080;">The world that made you 30% year after year after year beginning from 1999 to 2007 and it became—<br />
JS: But isn’t that part of the problem? Selling this idea that you<br />
don’t have to do anything. Anytime you sell people the idea that sit<br />
back and you’ll get 10 to 20 percent on your money, don’t you always<br />
know that that’s going to be a lie? When are we going to realize in<br />
this country that our wealth is work. That we’re workers and by selling<br />
this idea that of “Hey man, I’ll teach you how to be rich.” How is that<br />
any different than an infomercial?<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
Well, I think that your goal should always be to try to expose the fact<br />
that there is no easy money. I wish I had found Madoff (sp?)—<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> But there are literally shows called “Fast Money.”<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC: </span></strong><span style="color: #000080;">I think that people…There’s a market for it and you give it to them.<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> Yeah<br />
and there’s a market for cocaine and hookers! What is the<br />
responsibility of the people who cover Wall Street? Who are you<br />
responsible to? The people with the 401ks and the pensions and the<br />
general public or the Wall Street traders, and by the way this casts an<br />
aspersion on all of Wall Street when I know that’s unfair as well. The<br />
majority of those guys are working their asses off. They’re really<br />
bright guys. I know a lot of them. They’re just trying to do the right<br />
thing and they’re getting f—ed in the ass, too.<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
True. True. I think as a network we produce a lot of interviews where I<br />
think that we have been—there have been people who have not told the<br />
truth. Should we have been constantly pointing out the mistakes that<br />
were made? Absolutely. I truly wish we had done more. I think that we<br />
have been very tough on the previous Treasury Secretary (Hank Paulson),<br />
very tough on the previous administration how they didn’t get it, very<br />
tough on Ben Bernanke. But at the same time.<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"> But he’s the guy who wrote the rule that allowed people to over-leverage.<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
I trash him every night. I’ve called him a liar on TV. What am I going<br />
to do? Should we all call him liars? I’m a commentator. We have—and you<br />
can take issues with the fact that I throw bulls and bears and I can<br />
still be considered serious.<br />
I’m not Eric Sevareid. I’m not Edward R. Murrow. I’m a guy trying to do<br />
an entertainment show about business for people to watch. But it’s<br />
difficult to have a reporter to say I just came from an interview with<br />
Hank Paulson and he lied his darn fool head off. It’s difficult. I<br />
think it challenges the boundaries.<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
Yeah. I’m under the assumption, and maybe this is purely ridiculous,<br />
but I’m under the assumption that you don’t just take their word for it<br />
at face value. That you actually then go around and try and figure it<br />
out. So, again, you now have become the face of this and that is<br />
incredibly unfortunate.<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
I wish I had done a better job trying to figure out the 30 to 1 and<br />
whether it was going to blow up. It did. Once it did I was late it<br />
saying it was bad.<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS:</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br />
So maybe we could remove the financial expert and the “In Cramer we<br />
Trust” and start getting back to fundamentals on reporting as well and<br />
I can go back to making fart noises and funny faces.<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JC: </span></strong><span style="color: #000080;">I think we make that deal right here.<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: #000080;"> JS: </span></strong><span style="color: #000080;">Mad Money airs on CNBC weeknights at six.<br />
