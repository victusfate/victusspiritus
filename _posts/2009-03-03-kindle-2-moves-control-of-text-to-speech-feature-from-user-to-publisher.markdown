<p>While it’s a lovely device due to the readability, storage, size, and efficiency. The <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/KindleTwo">Kindle 2</a> is still subject to the whim of the <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-10185538-1.html">large book publishers it seems</a>, and therefore any information that<br />

<p><em>"On Friday, Amazon announced it would reconfigure the Kindle 2's systems<br />

<p>Publishers will control the text-to-speech feature.</p>
<p>This type of feature change after the release of a product is frightening or at the very least damaging to Amazon’s market position for it’s Kindle Books, which makes it harder for <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/groups/Kindle2">web marketers and information merchants</a> to pitch the device to potential customers.</p>
<p>It amazes me that we are finding new ways to value information for it’s pertinence, quality, and timeliness on the internet but our vast riches of older written information must suffer in it’s availability due to old thinking.</p>
<p>I suggested a <a href="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2009/03/02/free-information-and-one-media-solution-that-id-subscribe-to/">simple solution</a>, one media rule that rewards any media authors based on the popularity of their works as well as sociably redeeming qualities. The capitol can be generated via ads to free users, or by subscriptions to those that prefer to avoid ads.</p>
