  content: We've been fortunate in that many folks have had a fantastic first experience
    with the app. More great stories than I can possibly ever watch have been captured
    and shared already. And we've only just begun.

  content: "Mark, you have always been a person who wants to touch lives and your
    passion is this form of human connection.  A part of what you are sharing will
    also involve how you serve this, how you come to frame it - and in the context
    of Cameo \"framing\" is ever so important.\n\nIt is the rediscovery of the hand
    and the eye, the collective collage of cameo's, and this reminds me very much
    of the maker movement - this return to craft, this rediscovery of personal but
    shared meaning.\n\nMaker Movement : We Are Makers\nhttp://vimeo.com/66162292\n\n\nMany
    of us talk of touch and feel, but talk is not movement, and a movement does not
    have to be a manifesto, but simply that which personally moves us.  It can be
    the simplest of things or it can be something short and sweet packed with so much
    meaning.  \n\n\n\nFor me the core of something like Cameo is not simply a making,
    but a moving or that which moves us.  When we share what moves us and move to
    that which is creative personal expression that is alive but innocent, basic but
    marvelous, in that movement what we are sharing is life.  \n\n\n\nThe Cameo. for
    me, is moving towards what moves us and in sharing that movement, a series of
    movements are created - and life is at its essence, is this interplay of movement
    - the Cameo we create.\n\n\n\n[Em]"

    Watching the video, brings a smile to my face. Can't say I understand all the movement and meta movements you mention above, but I can definitely relate to the connection of building, and sharing.


    Thanks for adding some great context to our launch!

    What I understand as "movement" in this context is what I explore here :
