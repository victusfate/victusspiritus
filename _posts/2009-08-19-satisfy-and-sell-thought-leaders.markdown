    on the other hand, have grown to respect the continued effort many folks make
    to share their experiences and insights without financial reward on a regular
    basis.<br><br>Do you maintain a blog? I&#39;m curious to see your take on other
    concepts, it&#39;s refreshing.

<p>The secret to developing an incredibly valuable and successful product, satisfying the stringent requirements of the chief influencers in that field.</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a software development environment that Joel Spolsky evangelizes and watch it explode virally throughout the coding world.</li>
<li>Create a marketing methodology that Seth Godin is excited about and links to from his blog and watch entire business sectors adopt your system.</li>
<li>Develop investment strategies that boost venture funding efficiency and returns in a way that catches Fred Wilson's attention and admiration. Then witness a movement of VCs and startup founders flock to your offering and follow your lead.</li>
<li>Got a far out near sci-fi concept that's just on the edge of possible? If Kevin Kelly blogs about and elaborates on your idea, you can count on getting noticed by his regular readers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The trend is clear. But is there a key aspect of marketing I missed?</p>
