<p>Thanks to a helpful reminder I got the <a href="http://victusfate.github.com/html5_chaos/">html5 chaos</a> field working smoothly with client side file based coffeescript (.coffee) . I found the effect <a href="http://29a.ch/2010/12/15/particle-chaos-html5-canvas-demo">at Jonas Wagner's site</a>, and went through the practice of converting it to CoffeeScript. The process literally took an instant thanks to <a href="http://ricostacruz.com/js2coffee/">js2coffee</a>. The mods took a couple of hours to determine what was too slow or just broken about my CoffeeScript modifications. The one tiny issue I have with js2coffee is replacing 2 spaces with tabs.</p>
<h2>The effect runs much smoother in Chrome/ium than the versions of Firefox (5.0 beta) and Safari (latest) I have installed locally.</h2>
