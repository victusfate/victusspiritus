  content: You got to be kidding.  Panera has gone to hell.  <br><br>I&#39;ve had
    horrible experiences the last few times I&#39;ve gone there.  Trashed dining areas,
    rude staff and poor quality food.  This has happened on both coasts for me.  I&#39;m
    glad your experience is better.  But I wouldn&#39;t use them as a model for anything
    other than how to run a good franchise into the ground.

    others (kinda hard to clean a restaurant that&#39;s ALWAYS busy) but of the approximately
    10 locations (in IL, MI, and Canada) I&#39;ve visited more than once, I&#39;ve
    never run into a bad one.

  content: I gotta question the objectivity of this article.<br><br>I like Panera.
    I think my wife and I go about two times a month.<br><br>I think the food is good.
    It&#39;s not great (it&#39;s too salty, for one), but it&#39;s good. It&#39;s
    certainly better than many other fast food restaurants&#39; offerings. But I really
    don&#39;t have any trouble finding similar quality anywhere near me...I just have
    to avoid chain restaurants.<br><br>I am really struggling to see how the customer
    service is anything special, however. They take your order, you pay, then you
    go to the pick up counter where you can see the order prepared, if you know which
    one of the 100 they&#39;re making at the same time is yours. Then you pick your
    order, fill your drink and fight for the other million customers for a table.
    This is in no way different from McDonalds, except that the surroundings are cleaner
    and more attractive.<br><br>I&#39;ve seen my food get dropped on the counter.<br><br>I&#39;ve
    seen my order put on another customer&#39;s tray, then transferred to mine with
    some of the fillings left on that other customer&#39;s tray. <br><br>My order&#39;s
    been wrong more than once.<br><br>They&#39;ve forgotten about my order until I
    reminded them about it.<br><br>There is absolutely nothing special about their
    service. It&#39;s typical minimum wage service...sometimes you get lucky and get
    served by someone who gives a s***, sometimes you don&#39;t.

  content: I&#39;m definitely not an average customer. Maybe it&#39;s this particular
    store&#39;s management, but I went 5 times their opening week. I have seen and
    talked to employees there who I recognize, and who are cordial and polite. They
    don&#39;t appear to be unhappy working there. Either they are excellent actors
    (doubtful) or working for Panera is a better experience than other fast food chains.<br><br>I&#39;m
    not the only diehard Panera fan. Some combination of food, style, and setup is
    very appealing to me as a consumer. Totally respect that this is not the case
    for everyone though.

  content: 'Maybe I&#39;ve made you a sandwich.<br><br>First of all, the Paneras on
    Long Island are all franchised, so I don&#39;t know how they are nationwide, but
    they treat us great! Whenever new stuff comes out, we usually have a meeting sort
    of thing (we used to call them "bread bashes" but I dunno anymore, we stopped
    for a little while but then started again) where we get to try the new stuff and
    learn how to make it. At the one I work at in Hauppauge, the management tends
    to be very laid back, but still assertive. Meaning, if you do something wrong,
    you know about it, and if guests complain, they tell you what&#39;s going on and
    expect you to know how to fix it. But other than that, it&#39;s a great environment
    full of fun people to talk to while doing whatever you&#39;re supposed to be doing.
    For instance, I work on the line, so while I&#39;m making sandwiches/salads/giving
    people their orders, I also tend to talk to the guests or other people who work
    with me, and the managers do so as well (and they&#39;re good to talk to as well).
    We have regulars, and we generally know what they&#39;re going to order before-hand.
    Also, between the people who work on the line, we like to try to guess what people
    are going to order, do things like that. I have fun working there, and I know
    a lot of my coworkers do as well. I&#39;d work during school too, but I don&#39;t
    have a car to travel to the nearby Panera (I go away to school).<br><br>There
    will always be people who aren&#39;t motivated, or people who don&#39;t like their
    job, no matter where you work. I tend to get very annoyed when my coworkers do
    dumb things like halfass an order. But stuff happens sometimes. Occasionally the
    computer malfunctions, or an order gets "bumped" early and we have to ask a guest
    for their receipt or verify their order. A lot of the time this happens with to-go
    orders, because while the computer lets us recall to-stay orders, it doesn&#39;t
    let us recall to-go orders, and if one of us accidently "bumped" one off the screen,
    there&#39;s no way to get it back. That usually explains the few times we forget
    about an order. We tend to pick up on those rather quickly, though, unless you
    sit down (in which case, we have a bunch of bags behind the counter, but don&#39;t
    know where they go because there&#39;s nobody waiting for them, and the order
    got bumped from the screen). Another thing that happens sometimes is confusion
    with the trays on the counter. This happens because when it gets busy, two people
    will "consolidate" the orders. One person generally sets up the trays, and the
    other will put soups on them. Sometimes the first person knows what he/she&#39;s
    doing, but the second person isn&#39;t aware that the first person went slightly
    out of order because someone ordered something that&#39;ll take longer than the
    others, and will put the wrong salad on the wrong tray. This is almost always
    fixed before we call your name, but people tend to take the order before we&#39;re
    finished with it (which is usually fine), which causes confusion for us and for
    you.<br><br>That&#39;s about all I have to say. I&#39;m happy to hear you&#39;re
    happy with us (:'

<h1>More than just sandwiches</h1>
<p>Last week a new Panera Bread restaurant opened up down the street from my house. They are the zen masters of soup and sandwiches. Nearly everyone I talked to eagerly awaited the store to start business. There was buzz created for months just seeing the building go up. This word of mouth marketing power is well earned by the business.</p>
<p>From top to bottom Panera is designed to serve fast food that tastes great. The decor and vibe is well suited to a fantastic breakfast, lunch or dinner. Their bread and other baked goods are all freshly made in house before the store opens each morning. The soups are always hot and delicious. But enough about this particular store, let me go over briefly why I believe Panera Bread is such a successful business model.</p>
<p>Quality Food<br />
1) The business focuses on this number one discriminant between restaurants. It achieves high quality flavor by focusing on a core selection of food. They make the best soups, sandwiches, and baked goods. That's it. It does this at a price that is well matched to the eating experience (somewhere in cost between Mcdonalds and a diner).</p>
<p>Service<br />
2) From the time an order is taken, to the moment a customer's name is called, and throughout the dining experience, we are made to feel welcome. Drinks are self served for the most part (fresh lemonade or specialty drinks are made behind the counter), which grants folks free refills. This is a big plus for those that guzzle down a couple of iced coffees during a meal. Employees for the greater part appear to be enjoying working there. This is a huge plus for customers. Seeing folks making your food that are generally happy instills greater comfort and trust in customers.</p>
<p>Style<br />
3) The dining area is arranged to feel cozy yet comfortable. Each booth or table caters to a relaxed and open eating experience. Customers can clean up after themselves, while employees wipe down each eating area intermittently.</p>
<p>If you're going to start a business in any area, repeat after me, "be like Panera". They're the best in a highly competitive space.  </p>
