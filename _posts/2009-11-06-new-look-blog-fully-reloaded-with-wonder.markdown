  content: I cleaned it up, and found some wonderful background art. I had a problem
    though, a sharing (drag and drop) plugin was resizing my content width to 440
    so I deactivated it. A Shane I really liked what it does.

  content: Mark<br>I like it! Inspired, like yourself;) I&#39;m working in real time
    on a redo of my blog. My pop art roots and personal DNA have driven me in a completely
    different direction. I&#39;ll ping you when live.

  content: Awesome, I&#39;m psyched to see it. Of course I can&#39;t read the comments
    as  easily here. I&#39;ll have to fix that :D

<h1>I spent a few hours of this morning drooling over imagery</h1>
<p>I don't just mean gorgeous, breath taking, OMG I want to see that in real life photos. I literally mean drooling, they were that sick/incredible. It's not just the awe inspiring HDR lighting that is applied, but the perfect scenic locations and framing. The photographer is <a href="http://www.stuckincustoms.com/">Trey Ratcliff</a>.Â I've probably linked to his work (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/">stuckincustoms on flickr</a>) at least a half dozen times, without consciously making the connection that the shots were all taken by the same photographer. I'm hoping to add a <a href="http://www.meebo.com/">meebo</a> chat bar to the bottom of the page (non-intrusive communication thingy) based on Trey's great photo-blog layout, but it looks like I have to wait on an ok from their business reps first. Worst case I can easily embed a side bar chat widget.</p>
