  content: "As I mentioned, it changed passive way too early browsing into more of
    a store interaction. Many folks dread when a service person walks up and asks
    \"can I help you with anything?\" I think it's an opportunity.\n\nHave you encountered
    it on any other sites? Michelle mentioned she came across it on a few other sites,
    and I remembered Rackspace had something similar.\n\nBtw, loved the Minecraft
    music video you liked on youtube and added it to my holy crap minecraft post. "

<a href="https://www.thesunnytrail.com/">Sunnytrail</a> is a new service dedicated to tracking business transactions (revenue, churn, lifetime value, arpu) through an API, and helping web companies focus on developing their own products instead of rewriting tracking utilities.</p>
<p>The following image is a glimpse at a sample dashboard.<br />
<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011/01/dashboard.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6670" title="dashboard" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011/01/dashboard.png" alt="" width="500" height="400" /></a><br />
The Overview tab captures top level metrics that matter such as total free vs paying users, monthly revenue and the average revenue per paying user. In addition there's a Stream tab with chronological activity and a Plans breakdown of transactions.</p>
<p>The API has supported sample code in Ruby, Python or PHP but shouldn't take much effort to pass your transaction data to Sunnytrail.</p>

<p>One of the immediate wins for Sunnytrail was sending me an instant message as I poked about their pricing page. Octav mentioned it was cool if I shared the IM, and I think it'll transmit a good vibe about how the company feels at this stage.</p>
