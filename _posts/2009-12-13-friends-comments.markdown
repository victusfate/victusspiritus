  content: Thanks for the reminder, you&#39;ve been added of course!<br>I only receive
    and carefully read through a dozen or so emails of yours at a time, a handful
    of project updates, and a dedicated 5-10hours of shared desktop working a week.
    I&#39;d say you&#39;re definitely a friend and influencer :D
