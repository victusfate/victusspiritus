<p>I've had a wonderful opportunity these past few months.  By unplugging from the majority of my responsibilities as a simulation/systems engineer I was able to discover a passion for writing, and learn how to share my discoveries.  While I return to work today, I pledge to continue reading, processing, writing, and connecting.  The same concepts that this blog was founded on just a few months ago hold true.</p>
<ol>
<li>From <a href="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2009/02/22/a-new-journey/">my first post</a>: "My deepest wish is that by<br />
sharing my humble perspectives, you, the reader, will gain a quantum<br />
of motivational energy sufficient to spark a powerful and positive<br />
decision and corresponding path for your own life.</li>
<li><span>Thanks to bloggers like <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a>, <a href="http://www.avc.com/">Fred Wilson</a>, and <a href="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/">Kevin Kelly</a> (and many more) I've been inspired with an array of concepts and views that have enriched my own growing perceptions about life, business, and discovering one's calling.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>That brings me to some incredible new opportunities.  President Obama selected Aneesh Chopra as the nations first Chief Technical Officer (<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/04/aneesh-chopra-great-federal-cto.html">Tim O'Reilly's article</a>).  I'm confident he will have a major hand in helping to spearhead <a href="http://www.gov2summit.com/">Government 2.0's implementation</a> and improve the service nature of our representatives with modern social technologies.  This will create an array of new tasks focused on improving the efficiency of our growing beaucracy.</span></p>
<p>Here's a 50minute video of Aneesh Chopra discussing his experiences and concepts:</p>
