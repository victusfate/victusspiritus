    Thanks for the blog post!!!

    You put the deck into better perspective than I did by including Mike's notes on maximizing iterations. Well done!

    Cheers,
    David

  content: "Thanks for stopping by David. \n\nMike clearly laid out his thinking,
    and referenced your slide deck as a dashboard of monitoring an early startup.
    All I did was rephrase his post as a learning exercise and self reminder. Your
    presentation was much appreciated.\n"

<p><i>The breadcrumb trail to a slide deck</i><br />
Lost in the haze between 3-4am this morning I read <a href="http://mike.posterous.com/maximizing-iterations">Maximizing Iterations</a> a post by Michael Montano, co-founder of BackType. I was guided there via <a href="http://twitter.com/nathanmarz">Nathan Marz's</a> tweet stream. There's a growing trend among entrepreneurs to acknowledge the uncertainty of untested business models. In short, there is no business model until you actually build it. Each iteration is another chance to test a model.</p>
<p>The challenge is to maximize the number of iterations of your business, a practice evangelized by <a href="http://startuplessonslearned.com/">Eric Ries</a>.<br />
<a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/content1.png.scaled10001.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5918" title="content.png.scaled1000" src="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/content1.png.scaled10001.png" alt="" width="300" height="150" /></a><br />
The number of iterations (N) is unit less. Runway and iteration time share the unit of time (T=days) and if the former isn't bigger than the latter you're done. Cash is your favorite currency($), and burn rate is currency/unit time ($/T). This no nonsense formula is a focusing element for optimization effort, lest we get lost in the process and lose sight of the problem we're struggling to solve.</p>
<blockquote><p>
# iterations = cash/(burn rate * iteration time)<br />
N = $/( ($/T) * T) yeah units
</p></blockquote>
<p>That's it. You can increase cash, or decrease the product of burn rate and iteration time. Make note that burn rate and iteration time are related entities. Four coordinated and talented hackers out iterate you working solo, but they cost more. If your startup survives long enough to zero in on a model, you'll want to raise the burn rate to leave competition in the dust, completely overhauling your company focus from search to execution. </p>
<p>Without further introduction, here's <a href="http://twitter.com/dcancel">David Cancel's</a> slide deck that put's the startup process in perspective:</p>
