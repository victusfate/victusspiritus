<h1>Hire Experts</h1>
<p>If you have some solid ideas for products and/or services to found a business on, your best bet in addition to coding up some early prototypes is to hire an expert. Even if you can't program at all, if you negotiate a consulting cost for the work up front and funnel your other income into the hands of a pro it will save you time. You may as well get used to the idea early of paying professionals to help take your abstract ideas and make them a reality.  </p>
<p>I've tried attracting web programmers for months to a pet project of mine. While I was able to quickly get a very rudimentary version working, it's costing me precious time to get past the baby steps, time I can ill afford. While I enjoy learning about web technologies (mysql, Google App Engine/data store, and Scala) the process of getting those platforms/protocols/languages to quickly produce functionality I desire is cumbersome. Just learning the basics of oauth took me a couple of weeks, and I still haven't integrated that with my sample code.</p>
<p>The project I'm referring to is a semantic search and advertising layer. A simple version is live at <a href="http://www.victusmedia.com">Victusmedia.com</a> which I'll embed in an iframe below. You can search or fire off ads based on user Twitter status. <a href="http://vukicevic.blogspot.com/">Vladimir Vukicevic</a> has supported the concept since it's inception and while he's not a developer, I have little doubt his expertise will prove invaluable going forward (certainly once we narrow it down to the right problem/formally create a business).</p>

<p>I've got a short list of developers I want to hire, so the last couple of months weren't a total loss. I need to estimate how much it will cost for an incremental build that I can leverage to pursue outside funding.</p>
<p>Good hunting fellow developers, business founders, and blogging enthusiasts. The world won't stand still so don't wait too long to strike the inspirational match.</p>
