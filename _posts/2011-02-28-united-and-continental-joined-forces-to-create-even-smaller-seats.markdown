    Mark,
    Shame on you for taking average air lines.  Please inform the airline that you are have a vertical surplus, and need special accommodations prior to getting a seat assignment.  Your employer cannot provide torturous travel arrangements, only.  Seriously, dangerous physical ailments (deep vein thrombosis) can be a result of being cramped in an airline seat

I'm short on time today due to a cross country technical meetup (working meetings are groovy). My relatively large frame was squeezed into the bucket seat like a dozen clowns in a car made for one. I could get past the butt hugging chair, but the major issue was a total lack of leg room. My knees were jammed up, even more so when the <i>gentleman</i> in front of me leaned back. After a little under four hours, I was ready to write off flying with United or Continental ever again. If the shrunken seats and missing leg room are the sign of things to come for the new merged airline, they can count on alienating tall travelers. In their current state, flyers would benefit from a measuring stick outside of the gate that prohibits tall people from going on a torturous trip.</p>
