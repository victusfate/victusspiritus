  content: "Our typical view of micromanagement is in the way Tom Preston describes
    it.  I would suggest that this typical view is a linear way of seeing what people
    do to each other, rather than with each other.  This creates a direct linear relationship
    between distrust and management.\n\nI would like to suggest that it is possible
    to explore a dynamic relationship where micromanagement is redefined into something
    completely different, but that relationship is between management and leadership. 
    I love the metaphor of DNA so that is what I would like to attempt to utilize
    this morning.\n\nJust like the metaphor of DNA, I would like to split management
    and leadership into four constituent parts viz:\n\n<b>Micromanagement\nMacromanagement\nMicroleadership\nMacroleadership</b>\n\nThen
    I would like to add two steps.  The first is to define management as a practice
    within us, while leadership is where aspects such as trust come into play.   The
    second is to think about junk.\n\nManagement as a practice is articulated well
    both by Peter Drucker and Henry Mintzberg, and management as \"a practice within\",
    is where the first two parts of the DNA become micromanagement and macromanagement
    i.e. our mental body and the physical body.\n\nIf we think of our body as this
    amazing gift, how we see management should be linked to the core of life management,
    which is that we are all living species of practice - how we feed ourselves (the
    macro), how we think (the micro), means that management becomes a very concrete
    thing.  In turn once we realize management is very much that which is within us,
    and therefore it should be articulated in the work place, and in our homes as
    well - as a practice.\n\nLeadership as trust makes infinite sense because the
    act of leadership takes us into the space of our creative being.  Management is
    not a shared experience, leadership is.  The practice of management is essential,
    and the application of leadership is vital.  That is why the final two parts of
    this DNA should be viewed as the external relationship between microleadership
    - leadership that touches directly and macroleadership, leadership which flows
    further afield. \n\nThis way of thinking makes a lot of sense as I formulate these
    thoughts.  Perhaps once I have hit the send button, I will look at it more differently
    - reminding myself that I am thinking and typing in the moment.  What seems self-evident
    to me is that this has to be far more than rethinking \"micromanagement\" into
    a practical context (rather than a toxic one), but that the real question for
    me is how we deal with what can be akin to junk DNA.\n\nFor scientists junk DNA
    gets its name, because science does not know what it does.  It is the uncertain
    and mysterious aspect of actual DNA.  Likewise, a dynamic view of management and
    leadership should IMHO contain this unknown glue, which in the words of a local
    media friend represents \"surprise\" and \"delight\".\n\nIMHO if we focus on toxic
    explanation we remain in the sludge of what we do against each other, whereas
    I prefer to redefine the universe for my own learning purposes - and that means
    I take the liberty of playing with ideas, which I consider to be a part of the
    soul of innovation itself - and that the more I focus on the creative reconstruction,
    the less it becomes creative destruction.  \n\nWhat we don't want to destroy is
    human spirit and if it is helpful to look at management and leadership as micromanagement,
    macromanagement, microleadership and macroleadership, then I think it should be
    in the best sense of those words - and in so doing - we might achieve what it
    is we focus on.  In other words, by focusing on what goes right, we have a much
    better handle on what goes wrong.\n\nThe beauty of all of this is the junk DNA,
    because obviously in nature it plays a role that has not revealed itself to us
    - so that means together with redefining terms into their positive nature - there
    is the humility of all that we don't know and will never know - but there lies
    the real beauty, to trust ourselves and the process of life making rather than
    life taking processes.  Then our I think our headspace is in an entirely different
    sphere.\n\nFor me that joy is called learning because it is this type of learning,
    that has made civilization possible.  When we avoid the reality of our junk DNA
    we try to fill the void with superstition and a void can only suck us into a dark
    place, but true trust for me is that junk DNA contains the essential aspects of
    our collective humanity.  \n\nIMHO civilization only takes us to the borders of
    humanity, it is we who have to trust to make the leap into humanity itself, and
    as such things like sorrow and sadness are merely markers on the journey of walking
    towards our humanity.\n\nStart from the goodness of our thoughts and thanks to
    the notion that there is junk DNA, who am I to say what makes a greater life journey,
    other than exploring it as I have done here and noticing the goodness.\n\nYours
    Thoughtfully,\n<b>M.</b>\n\n"

    You brought perspective to an emotional sore point for me. Thanks M.

    I cannot yet separate that emotional context from the continuum of meaning that micromanagement may have. I will think more about micro and macro leadership and what they mean to my journey.

  content: "I absolute agree that being micromanaged is absolutely awful, it is a
    waste of human capability, a surrender of human potential and a destruction of
    discretion.  The way I have used micromanagement in the above write up this morning
    is as emergence.  That is also exactly why I like putting on my \"Emeri Gent\"
    hat on, like I am doing right now, for it enables me to think of all human thoughts
    that flow in regard to the supernal and the complex.  \n\nThere are some terrific
    writers in the field of complexity science such as \nStewart Kauffman who talk
    of \"tiny differences\".  I found a great PDF written by Linda Laidlaw who speaks
    of how tiny details impact her educational life :\n\n<b>\"On the Importance of
    Little Details . . .\" by Linda Laidlaw</b>\nhttp://ccfi.educ.ubc.ca/publication/insights/v09n01/pdfs/laidlaw.pdf\n\nI
    would never open the door for anything that I am not personally ready \nfor in
    my own journey, but in my head space, I don't want memory space \nthat links the
    word \"micromanagement\" to past hurts or terrible or inhuman experiences.  Instead,
    like a person who decides that code should be rewritten viz. the old program may
    not be relevant, or it does not work etc etc, I will keep the word \"micromanagement\"
    but overwrite the old hurtful associations with new life expanding associations.
     \n\nWhat needs to heal in my life will heal over time, but I will aim to change
    \nthe triggers that open the door to painful reminders, while understanding that
    coming to terms is an intensely personal process which is unique to each individual. 
    The word \"micromanagement\" should be discarded if it carries far more emotional
    baggage.  Learning to let go is a slow process because the more we become human,
    the irony is the more capable we become of seeing the inhuman.\n\nThe way I looked
    at these terms this morning was through the lens of finding new life codes, that
    can replace the coding that has led to make me who I am today.  In that regard
    the micro becomes atomic and the macro becomes cosmos - the little details matter,
    but they are not the only \"stuff of life\" - there is big details of an entire
    universe.  \n\nThe question for me  is whether those little details (the micromanagement
    of my own life code) are capable of overwriting not the malware - but the \"mal-aware\". 
    The \"mal-aware\" are those people who just don't see life like you and I  do,
    and they consequently micromanage people, without any interest in improving quality
    of life.\n\nThe compass direction of thinking through the gold of \"Emeri Gent\",
    helps me to look at my life through a particular context.  It is not meant to
    make me an expert in complexity science, but hopefully a more rounded and self-aware
    individual - but that depends not on how much I read, nor how much I understand
    - but how I integrate that understanding.  \n\nWhen I talk of management, it is
    free of the memory of what awful managers and even more awful theorists have done
    to the term, and when I talk of leadership, I refer to the capacity of my own
    state of leadership, the micro therefore being convergent and the macro being
    divergent (i.e. the ability to zoom in and zoom out in relationship to the big
    picture of life).  \n\nYet I am very good at flying high in the air, and as I
    have said before, my journey requires me to become more grounded - and that is
    the domain of \"management\".  \n\nIn terms of complexity itself there is a nice
    PDF by Michael Holbrook which serves as a great intro in the subject, but as I
    have said, my online journey isn't about convincing others of argument, selling
    a certain expertise or changing others.  I am a work-in-progress and there is
    plenty of damaged life coding in my own existence for me to rewrite and renew.
     \n\n<b>Adventures in Complexity by Michael Holbrook</b>\nhttp://www.amsreview.org/articles/holbrook06-2003.pdf\n\nThe
    important thing for me is that we both appreciate that we are on a journey and
    that to me is something we understand, but my own experiences have informed me,
    it isn't necessarily a thing that many other people might be clued in about or
    even care to know.  \n\nWork-in-progress requires me to improve in my own life
    management and life leadership - and so long as I don't get caught up in the knots
    of my own inquiry and learning - I am a free bird exploring and finding ways of
    utilizing this worked freedom to touch upon and discovery what it really means
    to live intelligently.\n\nTake good care my friend and as always, my best to you.\n\n<b>[Em]</b>"

    On this beautiful Sunday morning I awaken to read your response and it mentions a most interesting word - that word is "GIFT".

    The gift in a micromanaged view is the power of noticing, of those little details and the appreciation of moments.

    The gift in a macromanaged view is the management of our living system - our body, our environment.

    The gift in a microleadership view are the nucleus that we give birth to our - our family center, our workplace center and our village center.

    The gift in a macroleadership view is our ability to develop our wisdom and understanding to contribute to our world.

    Yet the gift itself does not exist in any of these micro or macro views.  The gift that unleashes the ideas that I have spun above is from life itself.  Life is the gift.

    Life is the gift and when it is accepted and opened as a gift, everything else that precludes from it is a bonus.

    I forget that, we forget that and the world forgets that - for this self-evident otherwise we would not be enticed by gifts which are opened separated from the wonder of existence itself.  The gift that is universal is life itself, the gift that is transient and disposable, those are mere thoughts, products or monuments of what life was, not what life is.

    So whatever it is I open now is a bonus, for the gift that keeps giving is life.  That does not mean that all conscious citizens in our world have this gift, the denial of this gift is plentiful and absolute in its cruelty.  The gift that keeps on giving is a flow, it is a breath, it is a total connection - a complete integration.

    What bonus we receive from life depends very much whether we view life as an abundance or as a scarcity - and it is a scarcity not in terms of wealth but in terms of life itself - a good question to which is what it is we are doing to rob it's grace and glory?

    For me life itself is the one time gift and everything that flows or flourishes from that point on is simply a bonus.  Of course there are temporal gifts and we can consume our pleasures on them, but they will be gone tomorrow - but while we still have life, it is always on, always present.  Some say that love is the gift, but without recognizing life as the one and true universal gift how can we deem ourselves conscious even about what love is?

    Complexity and ideas relevant to our shared 21st Century is but a bonus for you and I to explore.

    Heard a good one recently, Mark.

    Micromanagement: Failing to see the wood for the trees. ;)
---
<p>"Micromanagement is symptomatic of a lack of trust. The remedy for this ailment is to hire experts and then trust their judgment. In a startup, you can drastically reduce momentum by applying micromanagement, or you can boost momentum by giving trust. It’s pretty amazing what can happen when a group of talented people who trust each other get together and decide to make something awesome."<br />
