  content: You are right that Apple and AT$T - sorry AT&T - has created a closely
    guarded ecosystem.  For all the commercials that espouse "Think different, be
    different" blah blah blah Apple is in fact more closed than Sauron&#39;s evil
    Microsoft empire.  <br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong - the iPhone is a great achievement
    but there is also a strategy lurking here to lock people in.  Enjoyed your post.

  content: Hah David live the Lord of the Rongs analogy but I don&#39;t see it as
    an evil empire. In a world where people have choices it&#39;s self detrimental
    for a business to make an exclusive deal. The modern shopper not only wants choice,
    they expect it in all areas. If you take that freedom away from them, you&#39;re
    injuring your brand and long term business success.<br><br>Still in a desparate
    short term fight for survival I can see the appeal of exclusive anti-competitive
    deals. But are Apple and AT&T in that bad of shape?

<p>What we as customers end up with is a terrible choice.</p>
<p>We can buy the best hardware, but only if we</p>
<ol>
<li>lock in with Apple's OS</li>
<li>accept App Store censoring software</li>
<li>lock in with AT&amp;T as the only method of phone and wireless networking.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a fan of the hardware, and the software that doesn't restrict my decisions or choices, I picked up the original iPhone and recently the 3Gs. Now I'm actively looking for another way to get my phone/wireless support. The smart phone is in all regards a personal, and ultra portable computer. It has an attached camera, speaker and microphone. It's important to me as a consumer, to have choices in my service, independent of the computer hardware I choose. The good news I think I found a method that will work for me towards the end of the post (but T-Mobile service is spotty in my area...).</p>
<h2>A Step in the Right Direction</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://wikee.iphwn.org/news:pwnage">Pwnage tool</a> is a step in the right direction (<a href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/">here's their latest post</a>). But how many users will actively find and install a method to unlock/hack their phones in order to have a choice of providers?</p>
<p>This is a <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/2373142">Video of a Linux Install On iPhone Late in 2008</a>. I look forward to more progress in this area as purchased hardware can be "reclaimed" by it's owners.</p>

<p>There is some competition coming to the smart phone market inthe form of the <a href="http://www.htc.com/www/product/hero/overview.html">HTC Hero</a>. A short review article <a href="http://iphonehelp.in/2009/07/30/android-powered-htc-hero-vs-the-iphone-3g-3gs/">compares the iPhone to the HTC</a>, but the iPhone 3Gs still has an edge on processing power (although no multitasking support with the OS), and the video camera option.</p>
