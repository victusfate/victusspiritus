  content: I have never been attached to the "left brain" - "right brain" dichotomy
    and Mark what you have presented here in terms of the scientific method and the
    zen approach illustrated in the tea cup story which mirrors your comment about
    learning to unlearn:<br><br><a href="http://www.lectionary.org/Sermons/Hoff/Mark/Mark%252007.01-8%2C%252014-15%2C%252021-23%2C%2520OverflowingCup.htm"
    rel="nofollow">http://www.lectionary.org/Sermons/Hoff/Mark/Mar...</a><br><br><br>It
    is this approach which for me balances science with art and then we can look at
    the human mind, the neuroscience, the biology and the chemistry of it and recognize
    that the approach you are taking to examine this is a way into understanding our
    own minds.<br><br>Mindfulness AND hypothesis for me are a combination that equate
    with the Power of the AND, whereas a literal minded person would look at these
    things in isolation, the unifying paradox or framing or whatever perspective ensures
    we are "learning to see" is the beautiful surface of the value creation that people
    like and you and me are trying to engage in our world.<br><br>Taking my recent
    "time out" was very good for me, sometimes we need space, sometimes we need to
    test a hypothesis - there are so many different ways to come to this world.  This
    is where I will sign off this morning with a song that really sums all of this
    up for me:<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgVOR28iG_o" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgVOR28iG_o</a><br><br>I
    say Rock on Sly !  For me he is right on the money with that line "different strokes
    for different folks" !!!<br><br>[Em]

  content: I think its hard to balance the different hats we wear. The developer/creative
    side wants to latch on to the baby they have created, while the businessman side
    wants to kill anything that doesn&#39;t make money

  content: 'Thanks for stopping in Emeri. I&#39;m glad you had a mindful break last
    month, and appreciated the link, and song.<br>When I consider the balance of science
    and art: it is life, my way of the ninja, my method. I must continually juxtapose
    short and long term needs, with both internal and external value judgement.'

  content: My driving inspiration is to merge my creative/developer side with value
    creation. The business value will come with creative value. Focusing on business
    value alone will get me no where (or back where I began last year, frustrated
    with a job I have not attachment to).

  content: Changed link for Tea Cup to Zen Stories.  It is the first story from this
    list of 100.  Also let you know that I am taking a different tack from here on
    in with Disqus, which is now integrated with a process I refer to as "Socrates
    Science" - which will involve utilizing Disqus not as a reflective medium but
    an investigative one.  What I have to learn now is how to think in terms of Socratic
    questioning.  BTW Questioning is a perfect way of detaching from an idea apart
    from reflective silence - a.k.a. that most thoughtful of human virtues called
    a pause. <br><br>[Em]

  content: I got your "ninja" comment after I posted my last one, but I would like
    to address the "ninja" perspective.  I also think of method from the Japanese
    perspective, but both Ninja and Samurai.  <br><br>Both reflect well a Bible verse
    about being "wise as serpents and gentle as doves".  In terms of ninja, I normally
    associate with stealth and in terms of Samurai I normally associate with ones
    own "Bushido Code" (values) - taken together they add something to Matthew 10:16
    since in either "Way" one cannot separate both.<br><br>What I now want to also
    address is that creative/developer side with value creation.  That always reminds
    me of Einstein&#39;s famous picture:<br><br><a href="http://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2009/06/01/einstein-sticks-his-tongue-out/"
    rel="nofollow">http://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2009/06/01/ei...</a><br><br>I
    think we all have this ability to be a renaissance man and I think it is muscle
    memory or a habit/life conditioning we can break.  If Einstein had his wild "creative"
    side displayed on this picture then Benjamin Franklin, not to mention Leonardo
    Da Vinci etc, are quintessential renaissance men.<br><br>I can ask my first question
    :-)<br><br>What was it about these renaissance men that made them renaissance
    and can we find a similar trait or sliver of renaissance within ourselves?<br><br>[Em]

<h2>Hypothesis and Measurements</h2>
<p>The scientific method is founded upon taking carefully planned measurements to support or disprove a hypotheses. Measurements are a critical component of this process. Observations are matched to theory, and either strengthen or refute the supposition. An interesting footnote in this process is that there is usually a wealth of information in the measurements that is ignored for a single study.</p>
<p>In order to minimize the effect of bias on findings, scientists are best served by detaching themselves from each theory they seek to study. I see that this pattern extends far beyond labs and universities, even into the realm of early startups.</p>
<h2>Muppet with a Point</h2>
<p>This dates me, but I am a big fan of the Empire Strikes Back film. At one point in the movie the protagonist Luke is undergoing Jedi training with master Yoda (the muppet). Yoda makes a comment that is very applicable to early startup founders:</p>
<p>"You must unlearn what you have learned"</p>
<p>The point for founders is not to forget all they've learned, but to put that learning and assumptions under critical review and not let bias hamstring design choices.</p>
<p>If you just started working on a startup, you certainly have a hypothesis. But you may have no indication of how much traction the idea will have (we all want those future goggles). By implementing simple prototypes and bug ridden alpha versions you begin to gather feedback. If the idea is untenable it gets rapidy dropped, but if there is early success the idea evolves. We're in a highly dynamic design phase at Victus Media (there's two of us) and have had some interesting early findings.</p>
<p>As our <a href="http://imm.victusmedia.com">discovery portal progresses</a> (yup info overload, we're working on it), metrics become an excellent pulse on its performance. Right now the metrics are me asking friends, "do these entities make sense based on your status updates?" I've been fortunate to get quick feedback, even though our latest push has a few bugs (most new feature pushes do). We'll have them hammered out shortly and move on with plans to stream line the search page.</p>
<p><strong>The hardest part of design, is coming up with a compelling reason for users to visit, return, and love your work enough to tell their friends to check it out.</strong></p>
<p>It is when making future design decisions that bias can play a terrible role in blinding one from opportunity. Everything we've done so far is mutable. Tying ourselves to a framework, database, interface, or service is silly. Both Tyler and myself are highly critical of our own work, our reaction when interacting with our site is usually "so what". We both expect that when we come up with the right combination it'll be pretty obvious, and easy for users to understand. At the point that the project transitions from unknown to execution, we'll celebrate. But that's when the work of business building kicks into high gear.</p>
<p>This post is a reminder to myself to not get too attached to specific tactics while working towards a bigger goal (create massive user value using available data).</p>
