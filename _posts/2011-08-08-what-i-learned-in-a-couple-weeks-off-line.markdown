    as much as have been over the past couple of years. If something doesn't fit organically
    into my needs for information or tools I'll drop it. When an opportunity does
    feel right I'll be much more conscious of it, and dive ahead."

    These are great resolutions to live by.

    I'll borrow part of them for myself.

    Mark, you know it's both hotter and just as humid here. I also don't have the luxury of a 30 minute ride to the beach. At least I can get there in 2-3 hours, it's not too horrible but it's more than a day trip.
    I did get some good pool time last week, and a little sunburn to go with it. It was nice.
    I am in the process of assembling information so Nathaniel, Melissa and I can go and enjoy lots of cool local areas. He is right about the age where he is asking some really cool questions about the world around him.

  content: "This a great example of putting the \"social\" back into the expression
    \"social media\" - to escape the argument (which is really war isn't it - i.e.
    who is going to win the argument?) and instead substitute with living your life
    (which is really peace isn't it i.e. you are expressing what is within you to
    express).  \n\nThough I typically like to refrain from label creation, maybe the
    expression \"social fingerprint\" can work here, or maybe it can expressed more
    exotically and poetically - in being so authentically in touch with your life,
    you have transcended the Essel Blueprint - you have expressed online the Essel
    Fingerprint and you move forward in freedom in the Essel Footprint.  Another way
    of expressing that is, that you are definitely not a clone, you are the real thing,
    human as a human being is.\n\nThe way I see your pictures is of course expressed
    in that great phrase [IMHO] though it really should be IMHE, in my humble expression
    :\n\n1. The world keeps on spinning and so don't be spun.\n2. Soak in some sun,
    life is greater when its sunnier on our inside.\n3. Look around and also stop
    looking, you were born with life, life is.\n4. Let yourself unwind because there's
    intelligence in relaxation.\n5. Share your space and focus most on the love you
    are sharing.\n6. Literally alter your perspective then retrieve what was lost.\n\nWonderful
    pictures Mark - my \"ruach\" has been literally inspired meditating on them.\n\n<b>[Em]</b>\n"

    Em, you have a marvelous talent for expression, the act of "transcending one's blueprint" has a tremendously positive vibe. I'm joyful to have uplifted your spirit.

    There is a calm and potent presence which I have encountered difficulties cultivating in my past. Now, the frequency in which I find peaceful moments is on the rise.

  content: "The way I look at it Mark, the past and future of you is fully present
    in the present, that is why I like to think that the present is about being present.
    \n\nTo say instead that the <i><b>\"struggles I have faced have made me (in terms
    of character) the human being I am today\"</i></b> IMHO has great potency.  Such
    a view ends the separation of our past, present and future existence, to have
    those experiences inform our mind, spirit and body in the present moment goes
    by a simple expression, \"living one's life fully and in wholeness\".\n\nIt is
    within our human nature to recognize each other but in many cases of recognition,
    I usually hear the response as \"it has lifted our morale\" - but in those instances,
    I think \"wait a moe! or a minute!\" - because to think that means that we look
    upon the past as a pit of demoralization, that we are trying to be free of.\n\nI
    think Victor Frankl had it pretty spot on how he thought about meaning, so the
    way I think about lifting spirit is a watermark and not a depression.  I have
    compassion whenever we pull a human spirit from a hole or dark place, but I also
    think that the watermark of our existence is represented best, by the fact that
    my spirit is interconnected with the human spirit - so I celebrate the collective
    rise of the human spirit, rather than how it pertains to my existence.\n\nThe
    whole point of me using a pseudonym is to speak to the web of relationships as
    a whole, rather than in part.  For me raising up the spirit isn't a form of inspiration
    but a form of \"outspiration\" - that \"out\" is something you refer to as transparency,
    and personally for me transparency means being clear, seeing the whole where I
    can, not being obstructed in my view by data or people.\n\nIn the end our presence
    in the present moment is a small world in a big universe.  When I am most transparent
    is usually in the most hidden places, personal touchpoints where the act of rising
    is not a momentary thing, but a place called \"Planet Ocean\".  We can create
    \"Planet Ocean\" on \"Planet Earth\", but this spiritual lifting is both a clearing
    of the water we share, and also not about drowning in inspiration. \n\n\"Outspiration\"
    then is simply a flow of energy that when allowed to flow is the most transparent
    thing in the universe.  It is good to make the invisible visible, but that there
    is energy in nature that is not meant to be visible, and that energy is one we
    are all co-creators of - that energy has no name, but life itself - and we all
    can raise the bar and quality of it, whether we live our life in the known spaces,
    or the unknown spaces (which is all that humanity that contributes unseen). \n\nWe
    do need recognition on this Earth today because a part of being does not believe
    in the unbelievable - which is that there is a massive level amount of good in
    the world.  To surface that is \"Planet Ocean\" - to live that is \"Planet Earth\". 
    And don't forget, where the planet is not, space always is. :-)\n\nYou contributed
    to my \"outspiration\", because I celebrate the high quality of the person you
    are.  This outspiration is what I felt at the moment I felt it, then from there
    it is my personal responsibility if I raise the watermark of my life, which improves
    my outflow, or whether I am simply filling in the holes in my life ground, which
    increases my inflow. \n\n[Em]\n\"Emeri Gent\" @thoughtspaces:twitter "

<strong>The world keeps on spinning</strong> with our without us pushing. It's natural to step away from the wheel to refresh a struggling perspective. Especially when life feels upside down.<br />
<a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/upside_down.jpg"><img src="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/upside_down-764x1024.jpg" alt="" title="upside_down" width="630" height="844" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-9828" /></a>

Take a break and come on in, the water feels fine. Don't forget to bring a friend.<br />
<a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mark_and_michelle_sunken_meadow.jpg"><img src="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mark_and_michelle_sunken_meadow-764x1024.jpg" alt="" title="mark_and_michelle_sunken_meadow" width="630" height="844" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-9827" /></a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Soak in some sun</strong>, but not too much. There's a quality of sunlight that both refreshes and centers.<br />
<a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/sun.jpg"><img src="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/sun-764x1024.jpg" alt="" title="sun" width="630" height="844" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-9830" /></a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Look around</strong> for a paradise not far from home. My house is just a half hour away from the ocean, and in the summer it's a great place to cool off and relax.<br />
<a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ocean_view.jpg"><img src="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ocean_view-1024x764.jpg" alt="" title="ocean_view" width="630" height="470" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-9831" /></a><br />
The sounds of the waves are calming, there are quiet stories in the breezes, and beacons along the shore.<br />
<a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/beacon.jpg"><img src="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/beacon-764x1024.jpg" alt="" title="beacon" width="630" height="844" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-9832" /></a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Let yourself unwind</strong>. Even those with the most voracious appetites know how to relax.<br />
<a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/laid_back_piranha.jpg"><img src="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/laid_back_piranha-1024x764.jpg" alt="" title="laid_back_piranha" width="630" height="470" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-9833" /></a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Share your space</strong> with others. I'm continually astonished at how beautiful a place can become when filled with life.<br />
<a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/share_your_space.jpg"><img src="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/share_your_space-1024x764.jpg" alt="" title="share_your_space" width="630" height="470" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-9834" /></a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Literally alter your perspective</strong> by moving to a different vantage. Just a couple of weeks ago we paddled along the surface of the Peconic river by kayak. Yesterday we viewed the same passage from high up above, revealing the riverside environment.<br />

<h2>What did I miss while (mostly) offline?</h2>
<ul>
<li>I didn't catch which startups were funded, acquired and/or shutdown</li>
<li>I haven't heard about the most popular new services that launched
</li>
<li>
I missed out on any interesting coding or tech posts that I normally catch in my inbound
</li>
</ul>
