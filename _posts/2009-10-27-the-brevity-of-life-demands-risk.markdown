  content: Hello Mr. Essel<br><br>thanks for your good advises for our short life
    time ;)<br>Mr. Essel, I&#39;m a dot net programmer working for a company. I&#39;d
    like to change our website&#39;s news section to seem like friend feed. I mean
    smooth refreshing for latest news, like ff&#39;s new feeds. I&#39;ll be appreciate
    if you help me by introducing some resources like samples, ebooks, ... to read
    and learn how to do it. would you please?

  content: You&#39;re very welcome. I&#39;ll have to take a rain check on that news
    site explanation (I&#39;d like to know the details myself). I can recommend researching
    web APIs for real time data streams. Check out twitter or friendfeed&#39;s API,
    or the soon to be released (or already availabe) Eqentia API. Another sources
    of data could be River2 (Dave Winer&#39;s near real time RSS reader). A friend
    at my work and I were talking about the possibility of creating a hyper local
    semantically categorized news site. If he builds a shell (I&#39;d like to help
    feed it), you&#39;ll certainly see a link shared here on my blog.

  content: I can&#39;t agree with you any more on this one Mark.<br><br>*Real Living*
    is existing outside of your comfort zone.  Not stepping out of it once in a while,
    but moving out of it all the time.  Most die a little more each day but those
    who push the envelope remove their blockages and live a little more each day.  I
    definitely put myself in the second category.  It&#39;s been painful at times,
    frustrating as hell, and stressful, but the reward is that I am becoming more
    liberated as I face and assail each of my deepest fears.<br><br>This Is Living

  content: Your argument about risk avoidance and the items you placed in the list
    are disconnected.  I see nothing in your post explaining why getting a good life
    partner is avoiding risk?  And brevity of life!  A good life partner is probably
    one of the most important things.  I agree with the theme -- take risks because
    life is short but your list stinks as counter examples.<br>So to "succeed in life"
    <br>Be a rotten kid<br>disobey your parents<br>don&#39;t go to college<br>don&#39;t
    have a life partner<br>get crappy grades<br>...<br>I do not agree and I personally
    do not see the connection between risk, risk aversion, and the list.  Why not
    add play with nuclear materials barehanded or smoke cigarettes?  Nope.

  content: I couldn&#39;t agree more about the value of connecting with a life partner.  Would
    I advise people to find and connect with a life partner, hell yes!<br><br>The
    example I listed above is a list of what most other folks (society) instructs
    you to do as you grow up and older. There&#39;s no style or awesome discovery
    mentioned at any of those life choices. Our character, our personality, and our
    life story is formed by all the times we tread off the outlined path. Success
    in life isn&#39;t formulaic. By breaking each of the above suggestions in your
    counter example, you&#39;re simply creating another restricted path.<br><br>The
    risk is in looking away from the guide book, and deciding for yourself what is
    most important, and pursuing what you find fascinating.

  content: 'Thanks Mr. Essel, for your favor and kindly guide.<br>Sure, I&#39;ll be
    glad if you have a look at it and this is the IP which you can access the website:
    78.39.175.50 but, the site is under construction and it will take one or 2 day
    to be available for browsing. the second mention is that our website is in Persian
    language and I&#39;m not sure if you know Persian Lang (I&#39;m an Iranian) as,
    you won&#39;t be able to read the proper links to click and check the site. any
    way you can access news section by this URL: <a href="http://78.39.175.50/NewsShow.aspx"
    rel="nofollow">http://78.39.175.50/NewsShow.aspx</a> and finally: I know you are
    busy for yourself. so if you don&#39;t have time for guidding a beginner, I&#39;ll
    understand ;)'

  content: I&#39;ve gotten some good feedback from friends on the definition of risk
    and it&#39;s a tough topic. The list was produced as advice we are given throughout
    our lives to minimize our risk of "failure". Choosing when to divert is the magic
    of free will.

    fear change nor avoid taking a risk if it will improve ourselves.<br><br>However,
    some people believe free will is an illusion therefore .....

<h1>consider the risk averse lifestyle</h1>
<p>Be a good kid<br />
listen to your teachers<br />
obey your parents<br />
get good grades<br />
go to a good college<br />
get good grades<br />
get a good job<br />
get a grauduate degree<br />
meet a good life partner<br />
Have a couple of kids<br />
Save 10% of your paycheck<br />
get a few more good jobs<br />
Retire in 40 years<br />
Pass away and be forgotten in a few years</p>
<p>While there's nothing intrinsically wrong with the above, life to me screams of urgency. We are explorers seeking places unknown. On the other hand when each of the above activities are done with our full presence, they can be quite profound. </p>
<h1>Life challenges us to discover more of it's beauty</h1>
<p>There's no pattern to be followed for a fulfilling and satisfying life experience. We aren't born with an imprint of how best to find meaning in our existence. Embracing the often uncomfortable challenges of the unknown is where the magic happens. You'll never know how much satisfaction and productivity you can get out of each day, until you dedicate yourself to an effort you deeply care about. </p>
<p>There is an immeasurable richness of wealth and meaning unlocked by experiencing the unknown. Simply reading, or watching others recount their views can't do justice to the act of living it. As much as I try to develop my imagination it pales in comparison to the long lasting memories and depth of feelings induced by the real. (Imagination is still the heart of my curiousity, and curiousity is the rocket fuel to my imagination.)</p>
<p>Make a small change in your well grooved path. Reflect upon how it changes you. Perceived risk must be challenged to discover whether it is a construction of our mind, or a true danger to our well being. Safety doesn't often translate to satisfaction, and unfounded fear is the enemy of freedom. Ok, enough fortune cookie chat, have a great day everyone.</p>
