We are able to perceive only a tiny fraction of current events that are happening around us. Even given a narrow area of study, the rate of change eludes even determined observations. </p>
<p><I>A look at the present</I></p>
<p>Consider the realm of tech news limited to software, in specific web development. In this fairly narrow topic there is a buzz of activity which vastly out paces my ability to track. I keep tabs on a subset of developments in a few languages, several common frameworks within these languages, and a handful of the most popular database choices*. My source is social news filtering by following app/framework builders, startup CTOs/chief hackers and identifying the best posts and docs to batch read or refer to later with <a href="http://www.duckduckgo.com/?q=frankencuration">Frankencuration</a>. </p>
<p>All of that information gets piped up the abstract stack to data which describes the current state of web development. It's obvious that I can't even grasp a complete picture of the present, how can I reasonably expect to predict the future?</p>
<p><I>The Pinhole, a symbol for absolute focus</I></p>
<p>In an unknown future landscape, we can consider only what is essential to a particular goal when charting a course. The Pinhole represents the rational limit of prediction. Don't try and exhaust resources predicting a complete picture of the future. Pay attention to specific areas you have the greatest influence over and observe the strongest macro trends in the industry.</p>
<p>I'll refer once again to the state of web development tools. A heuristic method focuses on mastery with only a single technology stack that has a high probability of being supported in 5-10 years. One language, one framework, one front end, and only a couple of databases. Optimal persistence layers usually require a couple of core technologies, like a relational DB and memcached, or a nosql cluster and redis.</p>
<p>Well I'm off to steer my pinhole towards gearing up ruby 1.9.2 and rails 3.0+ with ruby version manager (rvm) on an ubuntu desktop and a brand spanking new iMac. Mega props to <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/blog/2010/9/23/install-rails-ruby-mac">Mike Clark</a> for putting together a super clear and easy to follow walkthrough that also works pretty well for Linux distros.</p>
<p><I>What I skip over</I><br />
(BIG) Note:<br />
* = The languages/protocols I try and follow, ruby, javascript, and html/http/css along with light python and php.  Beyond those few tools there are many more that I don't consider at all for web coding. There are also a broad collection of frameworks, servers, and databases which I don't read much about and many more that I likely haven't heard of.</p>
<p>Stuff I don't keep tabs on:</p>
<ul>
<li>languages: c/c++ (used for many years but never for web dev), c#, lua, f#, java, erlang, go, Haskell and lisps: scheme, arc, clojure</li>
<li>frameworks: django, grails, play, most eclipse/netbeans plugins, and .net anything (I have to use it at work, and it's pretty bloated/poor). I'd like to read more about node.js with express or sammy but haven't found an app that demands it. There are many UI design frameworks I skip: GWT, Mocha. I'm curious about iOS (and Android) but no project has yet demanded that I dive in deeper than hello world for those platforms</li>
<li>databases: Hadoop, BigTable, EC2, SQL, Postgres. I use Sqlite and Postgres through Rails' active record and via Heroku deployment but I don't follow them specifically</li>
</ul>
<p>The reward for reviewing diverse languages is quickly recognizing design patterns to common problems. I also enjoy hacking around with open source applications developed with a variety of tools.</p>
