  content: This reminds me of an anecdote from Crichton&#39;s book of autobiographical
    essays, Travels. If memory serves (and it may not, at this point -- it&#39;s been
    over a decade since I read the book) Crichton wrote about how when he used to
    stay at the Four Seasons in London a long time ago, he would stick lengths of
    tape to the side of the desk. He used them to "cut & paste" his typewritten manuscripts
    the old fashioned way. <br><br>Years later (after he started using a laptop or
    word processor or something, I think -- Crichton was an early adopter of computers)
    he went back to that hotel and the Four Seasons staff, trained to notice and anticipate
    their guests&#39; quirks, had stuck lengths of tape to the side of the desk in
    his room.<br><br>I suppose you are working on some CS 903 to minimize those sorts
    of situations, but I guess this could become more fine-tuned as it evolved. For
    example, in the case of the barista, instead of simply remembering what you drank
    last time you were in the coffee shop, the system might take into account time
    of day and seasonality. Maybe the last time you were in a New York Starbucks was
    a January afternoon, and you&#39;ve come to visit again first thing in a muggy
    July morning? Maybe you&#39;d want something cooler the second time? And so on.

  content: Brilliant example Dave, that&#39;s correct. <br><br>Crude initial forays
    into this business space will develop (or be replaced) by sophisticated personalization/suggestion
    methods as you expect. I suspect there will be early mismatches, and over time
    the learning systems which predict what you like best will get better or die out.

  content: Great article - glad you added the link to it!<br><br>I have little doubt
    this is the way it will ultimately go - although I see a few years and hurdles
    before we get there. <br><br>Digital marketing really will take on a whole new
    face.

  content: Thanks Woody. I&#39;ll keep myself updated with your ideas/blog. Although  <br>I&#39;m
    focused short term with actions, I like to have a notion as to  <br>where I&#39;m
    headed.

<p>There's a flurry of startup interest and social location apps that are working to glue the web to our physical locations. Tech enthusiast <a HREF="http://www.google.com/buzz/scobleizer/coPPo659Jg5/Location-based-services-shootout-Which-one-is-best">Robert Scoble</a> prompted a Buzz discussion (another location capable media) to determine which was the best service, with varied opinions weighing in. Physical location and orientation is but one piece of the puzzle to seemlessly weave the web within our physical world and social lives. <a HREF="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2010/02/15/augmented-reality-opportunities/">Augmented Reality</a> is the channel of opportunity that will enable a rich blending of mobile web, location/orientation, and most importantly social discovery and connectivity.</p>
<h2>Far Out Future</h2>
<p>Looking further ahead I can perceive <a HREF="http://kk.org/">Kevin Kelly's</a> vision of Internet aware chips connecting all things and beings. In his latest work "What technology wants", which he crafts using The Technium blog, I suspect we share the same conclusion: <i>technology wants to embrace every aspect of the physical world</I>. My expectation is that we'll have full control over our personal networks (unless Apple & AT&T build them). Nano-technology will empower monitors within our bodies to probe for health risks. Tiny particle size chips will also enable full 4 dimensional mapping (3D space + time history) of our environments and have instant communication to our minds' sensory processing centers. We'll literally be capable of seeing through walls (we already can with crude phone camera apps), and sense all around us zooming in our perception to probe for greater details. The utility and creativity of such adaptive augmented reality tools is near limitless. But there's a beautiful form of personalization that I haven't yet explored. The implicit adaption of our surroundings to our wishes.</p>
<h2>The Present</h2>
<p>The trajectory forwards we're developing at <a href="http://victusmedia.com">Victus Media</a> is boosted by semantic social "listening" tools. Like caveman paintings compared to modelling the <a href="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/europa.htm">oceans of Europa</a>, I've chosen to help make simple effective utilities that can pave the way towards an adaptive interconnected future. The start of our journey is introducing a pattern of web service behavior. Active web services can recognize the presence of a visitor, and use knowledge about a visitor's interests to personalize the experience. As developers we're always guessing and modifying tools to appease a large user base while alienating others. The ability to dynamically adapt a service to individual visitors will help familiarize new users and save proficient users time (two way search). </p>
<ul>
<li>A visit to a blog or news site could provide you with a list of posts on the sidebar which match your public expressed interests. This trivial to implement search overcomes the problem of comparing two unknown sets by connecting them (your interests with blog tags)</Li>
<li>A visit to a bookstore while travelling for business can be as comfortable as visiting one near home. By sharing your location and interests to approved third parties (businesses will pay for this privelege), the store could suggest relevant new releases that correspond to your socially expressed topics, previous purchases, and public friend recommendations. </li>
<li>Upon walking into a coffee shop for the first time the barista could begin making your favorite drink with a simple gesture to approve the process</li>
<li>A first visit to a virtual world like <a href="http://secondlife.com/?v=1.1">Second Life</a> could place your avatar in a starting location that best matches your array of current interests, or provide you with a more intelligent short list of highly probable matching defaults</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of adaptive information services isn't to remove choice, but to suggest a more rational selection of defaults to new visitors. Personalization is a competitive advantage future businesses won't have the luxury of ignoring.  </p>
<p>*note: we connect user interest tags to social IDs at the moment but the area of user ID is improving rapidly</p>
