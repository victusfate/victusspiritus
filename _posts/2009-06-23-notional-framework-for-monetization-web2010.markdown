  Framework Breaks the Problem Up</h2>\r\nThis framework is an extension of the ideas
  presented in <a href=\"http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2009/06/21/monetization-for-web2010/\">Monetization
  for Web2010</a>.\r\n\r\nSocial media provides the \"real estate\" for communications
  to happen. Whether social media is decentralized (ostatus, P2), or integrated by
  API and more centralized (twitter, facebook) the conversations are happening because
  people are connected. Without the backbone of social media this monetization would
  not be possible so they must be aportioned a piece of the revenue pie (20-30%?)."

  content: Simplicity intended and Muchas gracias for the affirmation. I believe the
    tools exist for the beta version of this package. It could open up doors to future
    iterations with highly interacting interfaces.<br><br>From a coding standpoint
    I&#39;d make this chart much more detailed, calling out specific scripts from
    a specific combination (say Google adwords and friendfeed embedded window). I
    had hoped to gather the interest and collaboration of bigger teams than myself.
    It&#39;s a win for all involved and is an inevitable evolution for self sustaining
    social media.<br><br>At least I think so ;) (end shtick)

  content: This is nice, social media as the ultimate party host. The entire experience
    allows for a cordial overall experience for the guest consumer. And the competitive
    incentives remain. You might draw an arrow from data extraction toward front end
    hosts sites as well, they are competitive to understand/grow their audience.

  content: Well let&#39;s consider the options.<br><br>1)As a startup you can attract
    some hungry young hotshot developers. And their&#39;s a payoff when the technology
    is adopted and/or the business sells. The penalty being potential competition
    with those you want as collaborators (Google, Microsoft, twitter, friendfeed,
    facebook, etc.) An open API could build up relationships, addons, platform potential.<br><br>2)
    Opensource attracts free developers, and lets all the players customize/configure/contribute
    to an API that satisfies all parties. It also engenders trust from the community.<br><br>I&#39;d
    have to say I&#39;m leaning towards startup but Matt Mullenweg appears to have
    combined the two with Automattic.

  content: 'Open Source projects and monetizing business models are compatible.<br><br>Open
    Source isn&#39;t a communist model, contrary to certain GPL evangelists&#39; perspective.<br>Open
    Source is a method of gathering people with the same need into a group to perform
    a<br>team task without restrictions on how that technology is used after the fact.
    So, if a<br>hand full of us decide to go after VC and start a company, another
    hand full decide to<br>develop a service as individual consultants and another
    group decide to continue<br>developing for our own selfish tangible needs (never
    redistributing the source), that&#39;s<br>all acceptable before we get started.
    It&#39;s nothing more than an agreement that we won&#39;t <br>hold each other
    harmless for the contributions we make. It&#39;s nothing more than a <br>prenuptial
    agreement amongst all players: developers, testers, end-users, implementers.'

    as long as you can work that source code development model into a powerful revenue

  content: Why is there always so much focus on advertising as the way to monetize
    content while allowing it to remain free? I think a large scale voluntary donation
    based model similar to the one at <a href="http://donationcoder.com" rel="nofollow">donationcoder.com</a>
    could work, if not at least supplement it.<br><br>It needs to be quick, easy,
    and secure for users to deposit into the system, and it needs to be as easy as
    clicking a "like" link to send a small amount of money to a content producer.<br><br>And
    I would define a content producer as one that contributes to the system, both
    with their own content and sharing the content of others. <br><br>In other words,
    if I share a link to one of your articles on a social network, and everyone likes,
    both of us should be rewarded for that, as we both played a part in either production
    or distribution of that content.<br><br>DonationCoder is one of the very few successful
    microdonation based sites/communities on the web, and one could learn quite a
    lot from examining their model and listening to what they have to say about their
    experiences with the whole concept. <br><br>Between <a href="http://www.donationcoder.com/About/index.html"
    rel="nofollow">their about page</a> and <a href="http://www.donationcoder.com/Articles/One/index.html"
    rel="nofollow">this article</a> from their founder (written after their first
    year), you&#39;ll find a lot of information that could be the springboard for
    much bigger and better ideas.

    I&#39;ll definitely look into it further.<br><br>At this time I&#39;m trying to
    focus on something small I can build that will better match the information I
    freely share, and the types of products and services that I would gladly purchase.
    Admittedly this is not the only way to monetize, just one concept.

  content: In a way, that&#39;s part of the problem. You are thinking small and just
    for you when what we really need is something large that can benefit us all. (not
    intended to discourage or condemn your ideas)<br><br>Ultimately, I would love
    to see a large company with a lot of reach get involved, not as a middleman looking
    to stuff their pockets with a chunk of the donation funds like companies such
    as TipJoy do, but as a benevolent non-profit community service project, for the
    purpose of collecting and distributing the funds.<br><br>The one company that
    comes to mind that could easily pull something like this off, is Google. They
    are about the only ones I can think of that have the kind of reach required for
    the implementation and widespread adoption of this kind of system.

  content: Myself and a few others are looking into this now. (Vladimir Vukicevic
    is helping with concept, my friend Eli is the only other coding help at the moment
    (we&#39;re both learning php). Some good advice from Jason Cronkhite/Dean Powers
    (they have another social media collaboration project that I&#39;d like to contribute
    to depending on time)<br>1) Getting statuses is easy.<br>2) Making sense out of
    them takes more time (Zemanta may help, got an email back that they may be interested)<br>3)
    creating profiles isn&#39;t hard but could take a little time, there are numerous
    social sites doing this already (when we add memory/personalization)<br>4) finding
    advertising aggregators that we can interact with by an API will take some research,
    Google has an API to adsense but it&#39;s only for sites with 100k hits/day.

  content: "Open Source projects and monetizing business models are compatible.\r\n\r\nOpen
    Source isn't a communist model, contrary to certain GPL evangelists' perspective.\r\nOpen
    Source is a method of gathering people with the same need into a group to perform
    a\r\nteam task without restrictions on how that technology is used after the fact.
    So, if a\r\nhand full of us decide to go after VC and start a company, another
    hand full decide to\r\ndevelop a service as individual consultants and another
    group decide to continue\r\ndeveloping for our own selfish tangible needs (never
    redistributing the source), that's\r\nall acceptable before we get started. It's
    nothing more than an agreement that we won't \r\nhold each other harmless for
    the contributions we make. It's nothing more than a \r\nprenuptial agreement amongst
    all players: developers, testers, end-users, implementers."

  content: "[...] a couple of days later I put together a notional framework with
    the help of friends, and began digging in to a metric crapton of web dev languages
    to figure [...]"
---
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-857" title="Monetization_Framework" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2009/06/Monetization_Framework2.png" alt="Monetization_Framework" width="480" height="380" /></p>
<h2>Notional Framework Breaks the Problem Up</h2>
<p>This framework is an extension of the ideas presented in <a href="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2009/06/21/monetization-for-web2010/">Monetization for Web2010</a>.</p>
<p>Social media provides the "real estate" for communications to happen. Whether social media is decentralized (ostatus, P2), or integrated by API and more centralized (twitter, facebook) the conversations are happening because people are connected. Without the backbone of social media this monetization would not be possible so they must be aportioned a piece of the revenue pie (20-30%?).<a id="more"></a><a id="more-843"></a></p>
<p>Web hosters (bloggers, companies, individuals) can engage in conversations on their own sites while sharing windows into the social media world. Folks that host shared media on their site empower and evangelize the social media brand (as I do with friendfeed with window real estate and twitter by content). By hosting their own content and seemlessly integrating their favorite social media "hang outs" individuals shoud see a cut of ad revenue (40-50%?).</p>
<p>Existing advertising networks (Google, Microsoft Ads etc.) have developed leading edge technology (algorithms) to match semantic meaning (meta data) from text to drive appropriate ads. In addition they provide a single stop for businesses to advertise to (business advertising aggregators). We can leverage their technology moving forward. (20-30%?).</p>
<p>But I'd like to see semantic algorithm businesses decoupled from advertising aggregators. That would comprise a four part business model allowing for greater competition and innovation within each space (with overlap). For example friendfeed could team up with wordpress to create personalized user profiles to better serve ad algorithms. Google could team up with web hosters to integrate <a href="http://wave.google.com/">Wave</a> real estate directly into their web pages (like friendfeed has done).</p>
<p>Edit: I added input from the meta data extraction algorithms to the front end sites, as well as user like/dislike information back to the social media platform and advertising aggregator.</p>
