    Hi Mark, great response and I agree with your goals, but need to respond to your critique.

    I agree wholeheartedly that 'Relevance' has become an ambiguous and overused term. But any concept that becomes murky in language should be held up in the spotlight, examined, and clarified, if we are ever to arrive at an objective definition.

    In my post, I am disambiguating the concept of Relevance from the concept of Personalization. As I mentioned there, these terms are being used interchangeably, contributing to the confusion. This is my attempt at clarifying at least one aspect of the term as it is currently being misused today. Much remains to be done, and these are just preliminary steps.

    clear - we are discussing Online Information Relevance! :)

  content: I respect your effort to disambiguate the words, although I'm reticent
    to use the word relevance without a long drawn out explanation of what I really
    mean. Far too often I'm guilty of using tech startup pop terms without taking
    care to clarify meaning. I've grown sloppy with "duck typing" memes, and wrote
    this post to raise awareness of my own behavior.

    I think one of the problems is that, at least in my definition, Personalization is a defining aspect of Relevance...that is, in my world, you can't be relevant without being personally relevant.

    On the other hand, you can have Personalization without Relevance (in fact I would argue that most social services are full of just this).

    Anyway - love the discussion. Thanks for getting it going!

  content: I had to throw them in as reductio ad absurdum examples of companies which
    prosper "based on delivering relevance" to highlight the overuse of the term.
    Of course the context was online information which you carefully laid out in your
    post, but perhaps the differences implied by this distinction are not as extreme
    as they would appear to be on the surface (optimal routing of needed products
    to customers, optimal routing of needed information to clients).

    Mark: I agree with you on the erosion of terms like "relevance". I also agree that Mahendra's post didn't really do enough to set up a good definition. He separated it from "personalization", but that's not enough.

    I'm still trying to figure out if this is at all an objective thing or if it is entirely subjective. Is "relevance" only in the eye of the beholder?

    We can agree that something is relevant to both of us, but the rationale for our judgement is just as likely to be different as it is to be correlated. If a provider is relevant to enough clients they win. The shared part of relevance is the important driver to businesses.

    Consider taste as an analogy to relevance. We each have a personal sense of flavor for foods, yet certain restaurants and chains are over burdened with customers. Is taste subjective? Even for me, time of day, hunger and recent exercise affects how much I enjoy different types of food.

  content: "I think I agree with you about the subjective nature of relevance as an
    analogy to taste.\n\nThere is a difference, though, and I think it is in the direction
    of the declaration of relevance. In the restaurant example, the chain doesn't
    claim to be relevant to an individual customer. Rather, the chain says: \"here's
    the type of food we serve. if you like it, eat here\". Each customer determines
    if it \"tastes good\" or \"is relevant to them\".\n\nIn the example of all these
    websites, the site is attempting to say to the user: \"here is information that
    I've determined is relevant TO YOU\". That's the opposite direction for the declaration.\n\nIt
    seems easy for a user to say to the website, \"yes, this is relevant\". But then
    the question is, how does the site use that info to take some future information
    and make the determination that \"you WILL\" find this relevant\"? "

<p>This morning I couldn't resist the urge to air out my issue with relevance as an overloaded word.</p>
<p><I>Echo Chamber</i></p>
<p>In the tech startup world, particularly in web services, the larger community binds itself to trends and latches on to buzz words which capture and convey the essence of those trends. We've witnessed many terms rise into popularity only to be watered down by frequent reference and repeated misuse. One need only mention bubble, scrum, agile, lean, scrappy, product market fit, traction, social proof, disruption, pivot, BOOM or smurf to see the term repeated, applied and attached to a hundred different meanings, many which are contradictory. </p>
<p>The social meme is a direct assault on the meaning and utility of language. Clearly defined vocabulary is a prerequisite for meaningful communication. If we don't agree on what a term means, how can we rationally discuss it.</p>
<p>The latest casualty to meme erosion is relevance. One of my favorite bloggers and esteemed TechMeme editor <a href="http://skepticgeek.com">Mahendra Palsule</a> generously provided a guest post on TechCrunch titled <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/03/the-age-of-relevance/">The Age of Relevance</a>. I can think of no single individual who is a better choice for authoring a post on this murky topic*, yet I came away from the post thinking that every startup or company seeks to provide optimal relevance per dollar to their customers. What's so unique about companies who declare their quality filters are targeting visitor relevance? Walmart and British Petroleum strive to be relevant to their customers. Do they belong in conversations about social search and serendipity?</p>
<p>In the post Mahendra speaks to the changing focus of startups from search, to crowd sourced discovery, to personalized recommendations to personalized serendipity, always with an eye towards the bullseye of relevance.<br />
<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/03/the-age-of-relevance/"><img src="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/relevance.png" alt="" title="relevance" width="500" height="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7518" /></a></p>
<p>I agree with many of his thoughts on personalization and individual value, yet I fear Mr. Palsule has attached too many meanings to a single word. We as a community of bloggers, builders, founders, readers, commenters, and evangelists must rise to the defense of meaningful terms and conversations. We should strive to dissect and fragment relevance and other overloaded words into separate terms to express precise meaning based on context, market and environment. If we fail to divide and conquer overloaded terms, the result is a growing tax on knowledge transfer, diminished value in conversations, and an eventual breakdown of communication.</p>
<p>Note:<br />
*= I can think of a dozen individuals who would be as passionate about relevance as Mahendra, namely startup leaders from </p>
<ul>
<li>my6sense, Louis Gray</li>
<li> knowabout.it, Kevin Marshall</li>
<li>Quora</li>
<li>StackExchange</li>
<li>PostRank, Ilya Grigorik</li>
</ul>
<p>and leaders of social filter companies and sentiment analysis</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Blekko</li>
<p> </p>
<li>Jawaya, Charlie Crystle</li>
<li>Hunch, Chris Dixon</li>
</ul>
<p>as well as algorithmic leaders in Google and Bing search or bit.ly analytics. These and every other company survives and prospers by being relevant to their visitors and clients. </p>
