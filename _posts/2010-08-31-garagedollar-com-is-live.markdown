    I really like it Mark: Great idea and good execution.

    I imagine you are open to some feedback or you would not have posted.

    I also found it just shows a blank, though nicely shaded dark blue to turquoise background, screen in IE. However, it works fine in Safari, Chrome and FireFox. I'm using IE8 on a Sony Viao 64Bit Vista Ultimate laptop.

    The initial view is maximum zoom of the Google mapped location. I think it might be better to go for a mid-level zoom to show the mapped location relative to its surroundings. Love the fact that you can map directions directly which, of course, does immediately show the location in relationship to other streets. Being able to map the from/to directions is very powerful.

    Perhaps you have this in the plans but it might also be helpful to allow finding location by zip-code: I suspect that people may have challenges when relying upon typing in city and state if the town name can be expressed in more than one fashion.

    It appears that you are drawing data primarily from Craigslist and, presumably, you are recording new sales information from the app back onto Craigslist? No doubt an excellent resource: I wonder if you might also find it valuable in the longer run to develop your own data repository - either to use in parallel or ultimately alone - because this could yield some monetizable data mining results at some point.

    So far so good: Quite impressed. Do you want to spread the word yet or hold horses until you are more ready?

    We have our own database, in fact the entire project is built within couchDB, it both stores the data and knows how to "show" it in a browser format. <br><br>We're exploring the best way to "prime the pumps" with some initial sales postings (I think Tyler used an online search tool).<br><br>How about we take all the feedback into account over the next couple of days (get it working in IE and mobile friendly), then beat on some drums. I'll kick off a Facebook and Google ad campaign to gauge initial interest at that time.

    Thanks Peter, really appreciate your feedback and support!

We believe the bulk of the classified market can and will be tied to location and interest. With GarageDollar we'd like to offer the first interface that caters specifically to folks who are looking for sales in there area, or people that wish to broadcast their sale to other shoppers in there area. If you're looking for sales in your area simply type in your town or state(i.e. New York State), or see all sales by entering USA. Click a sale marker for more information. If you'd like directions to a sale simply click "Get Directions" on the bottom of the sale information box.</p>
<p>*<strong>update</strong>*: We are experiencing some issues with Internet Explorer at the moment, please be patient or try it out with another browser (Safari, Firefox, Chrome/Chromium)</p>
<p>If you're outside of the US we haven't forgotten you,Â  once we've refined the application we'll reach out to global moving sales.</p>
<p>Cardboard signs and classified sections don't stand a chance against GarageDollar!<br />
