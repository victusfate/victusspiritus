  content: It seems to me that if Amazon would have taken half the money it used to
    buy Zappos and invested it into internal development and evolution, that Amazon
    could have achieved similar results. What they really bought was the right to
    kill (assimilate) a major growing competitor.

  content: The tried something internally in the shoe market, <a href="http://endless.com"
    rel="nofollow">endless.com</a> but it couldn&#39;t compete with Zappos. And Zappos
    was gaining steam with all the free PR/Marketing. I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll
    just pull the plug on Zappos, but they&#39;ll definitely mold it into the bigger
    Amazon solution. It&#39;s business so I can&#39;t fault them, but I&#39;m a little
    disheartened because I wanted to see more competition in the online sales space,
    as well as affiliate marketing.

<p>It's ironic that one of the stated rationales for Amazon purchasing Zappos was for their corporate culture. Such a purchase will ultimately result in the end of Zappos' independent identity and with it any resemblance to the culture it once had. The real reason I suspect Amazon purchased Zappos is to cheaply remove a future competitor. Yeah, I just said $900,000,000 was cheap. To own internet sales in the US a little longer, it's probably worth a lot more to Amazon.</p>
<p>I have little doubt that Zappos would have continued to grow in strength and become a real force within the internet sales business. They had something <a href="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2009/06/01/the-importance-of-corporate-culture/">unique and wonderful going on</a>, and unfortunately I can't imagine how that can survive when your only shareholder is the 800lb gorilla of internet sales, Amazon. I'd really like to be proven wrong on this hypothesis.</p>
