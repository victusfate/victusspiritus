  content: I have to agree with your last point Mark. Companies who are in the business
    of controlling human virtual relationships, communication and communities are
    going to be the last bastion of wealth in our society as everything else increasingly
    becomes more automated and cheaper.<br><br>The pace of technology means that everything
    that we can do with our hands is quickly being brought towards zero cost. So,
    by being in the business of what people do with their minds, we can position ourselves
    to be successful in the long term. :)

  content: And there will likely be exceptions to the trend which stand out based  <br>on
    overwhelming service and quality. Some vertical businesses require  <br>human
    creativity and expertise.

  content: I believe future marriage vows should include the internet a.k.a. <i>"in
    sickness and health, in malware and virus free, for richer for poorer, in blogging
    and in magnetic storms"</i> but joking aside, congratulations to you and Michelle
    in your matrimony.<br><br>The one thing I have come to know about people is that
    I assume that I know them.  In a networked world such assumptions turn the opportunity
    to discover into the same abject reality we have in meatspace where familiarity
    and security are the chief order of the day.<br><br>Negativity is mostly a habit
    (unless it is a disease and life is generally a healthy condition for the majority)
    and it can become an enjoyable habit.  If it wasn&#39;t professional comedians
    would erect a monument to Lenny Bruce to celebrate an era that is no more.  That
    isn&#39;t going to happen, the first instinct of a child is to pull things apart
    rather than create a higher order of magnitude.<br><br>Negativity supports the
    positive. If we have chosen to live in a culture of comparison, ambition and conclusion,
    then being positive is always going to be a challenge.  If we don&#39;t examine
    the underlying forces we can&#39;t change the resulting outputs.<br><br>We are
    not red state or blue state but a spectrum of cerebral and social diversity.  What
    is construed as a new tilt at being positive is simply the old trying to be new
    again.  This old is manners, morality and the recognition of the role virtue plays
    in our lives.<br><br>Of course it is a pleasure to meet a sensitive soul, with
    depth of an old man&#39;s wisdom and who has an open minded approach to life -
    but that is the exception rather than the rule.  When we try to turn these things
    into rules we are involving conditioning of thought rather than the liberation
    of the human spirit.<br><br>We confuse negativity with the outcomes of an industrial
    age education. We are taught to make points, to WIN arguments.  We are conditioned
    in our reactions to the new and we examine differences like animal who faces fire
    for the first time.  It is time to step out of our animal skin and into our human
    one.<br><br>Just as we are reaching a transition point, a coming of age (unlike
    10,000 hours that Gladwell speaks of, this can be viewed as 21 Centuries from
    point zero).  Of course the Jewish people will say <i>"Heh! We are 57, not 21
    like the gentiles"</i>, so I am using the Gregorian calendar as an indicator of
    where we are as a human race, so this becomes a metaphor for "coming of age".<br><br>If
    we are to raise the bar on life it has to be with our own life regardless of the
    standards others have chosen for themselves.  So now I look at people, I am reminded
    of Billy Joel<br><br><b>Billy Joel - Just the Way You Are</b><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjCoBTzrN9E"
    rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjCoBTzrN9E</a><br><br>By learning
    to more accepting and learning not to judge (and boy do I judge or I have judged!)
    others, the positivity, negativity, the raising of the bar on quality of life
    becomes a genesis which starts from the very place we stand.  Whether what others
    think we are doing is considered is intelligent is then their choice.<br><br>When
    we think we should be role models then we send the wrong message out, a message
    of dependency, a message that leadership will save thoughtlessness.  There is
    no message when a society comes of age, it matures because we don&#39;t treat
    people like helpless mutants or children who refuse to grow up.<br><br>Will I
    ever abandon negativity?  I recognize what the institution did to Lenny Bruce
    and I don&#39;t want to feel like I am a new form of police state, the self-policing
    state.  If the old institution was about ham-handed control, what is the difference
    if the new institution is subtle and clever in its form of meme&#39;s and manipulation.<br><br>When
    we focus on negative nancies we give them power and a legitimacy that they play
    a role in the social discourse.  They are not Lenny Bruce but dinosaurs and we
    expend too much time trying to quell or change them, they exist because their
    legitimacy emanates from the nature and purpose of our response.<br><br>To raise
    the bar requires the movement of a few.  It is a bit like claiming a town back
    that has been taken over by drug lords.  It is the little things that change into
    an accumulated transformation that becomes a big thing.<br><br>Anyway I could
    contemplate for hours on this but I write this because change is a constancy and
    I am in charge of my own personal transformation.  In the meantime, if you "Mark
    Essel" are reading this while Michelle is awake, I think I need to get on a flight
    to Mauri and read the riot act - this would not be negativity but in the words
    of mortal words of Nick Lowe<br><br><b>Cruel to be Kind by Nick Lowe</b><br><a
    href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0l3QWUXVho" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0l3QWUXVho</a><br><br>Congratulations
    on your newly wedded life again and on this high note of positivity, I wish you
    best with the great Mark & Michelle Essel life journey ahead . . . come to think
    of it, I can&#39;t actually think of a better wedding present than the union of
    a smarter networked economy, and that always begins best with tying the knot.<br><br><b>[Em]</b>

    just posted. I read it all but I can&#39;t say I fully understand it right now.
    <br><br>Mark has become a social network with his wife... upgraded to dual core
    processing. Congrats to him I say. :)

  content: Leland, the emergent nature of "Emeri Gent" is a pouring of my thoughts.  When
    I write under "Viktor Ovurmind" it as another form of examination.  Metacognition
    is the fancy word for thinking about one&#39;s thinking.  What is true is as you
    see it, that the most important network is the bond of love that is between two
    people.<br><br><b>[v.o.M.]</b>

    of activity for a week now. And although we both get broken sleep (no bed is like
    home for me), I can sneak by with a little less rest.<br><br>Thank you for this
    comment, it brought a smile this AM. Glad to see another mode of your commenting
    under Viktor. It&#39;s time I wake Michelle for a morning beach walk.

    really curious and have time, you can find more of them with Disqus. Perhaps a
    topical search would be an excellent Disqus add-on?

  content: Leland, putting on my Emeri Gent hat and taking off my Viktor Ovurmind
    hat just to add to Mark Essel&#39;s comment below; my principal learning in this
    emergent networked economy is the nature of information flow and how I relate
    to it.  <br><br>My journey online is all about thinking.  The wearing of different
    hats has been documented in the past, the best one is "Six Thinking Hats" by Edward
    DeBono as a different but related view of thinking.<br><br><b>Six Thinking Hats</b><br><a
    href="http://www.valuebasedmanagement.net/methods_bono_six_thinking_hats.html"
    rel="nofollow">http://www.valuebasedmanagement.net/methods_bon...</a><br><br>What
    De Bono has provided is a template for thinking about the way others think.  What
    I engage is my own thinking and therefore this is an emergent process.  I have
    no idea what is coming next, I am literally making it up as I go, but rest assured
    I am always "thinking" as I pour forth self-expression.<br><br>What I do know
    is that Emeri Gent represents one wing and Viktor Ovurmind represents another.  To
    fly in life we need both wings of imagination.  Having a left wing view as opposed
    to a right wing view is far too mechanical.  I want to personally fly without
    this division.  The journey itself is not self-serving or narcissistic one, it
    is always trying to relate and feed off the given environment one thinks within.<br><br>The
    onus for me isn&#39;t to dive right into growing ocean of information wealth because
    that is like wishing that we gain the Midas touch.  I don&#39;t want to touch
    everything I engage into gold.  <br><br>If I am seeking something material out
    of this journey or to be somebody, it dissolves into a wasted effort that is worthless
    personally to me.  Then it isn&#39;t emergent but calculating, deceptive and it
    is thoroughly based on the wrong motivation.  That isn&#39;t my way online.  <br><br>No
    matter how scientific we become about our own life journey there is always the
    human need for art.  I don&#39;t think we do justice for ourselves as looking
    at the artistic nature of our own lives.  We think we don&#39;t have time but
    we do.  We just flitter it away on stuff which we think is media that identifies
    our beliefs.  We are tethered to our media instead of figuring out how media enables
    us to be free.<br><br>There is a beauty in patience and breathing space - what
    the Greeks call "ruach".  To be thoughtful is a part of that beauty.  When I write
    in an emergent way, which is what "Emeri Gent" is, some of that beauty is traded
    for speed.  Not as a speed of rashness but because I have the ability to pour
    out what is a stream of consciousness.   This is a dangerous approach because
    it is shoot thoughts out first and ask questions later.<br><br>I call this expression
    rather than a comment because the value of asking questions later is the ability
    to re-read the words of the guide (here the guide is Mark Essel) and in my response
    to you your words serve as the guide.  <br><br>I then look at the words again
    in a new context because that new context is my own given life, it is the singular
    context that I know best.  The stream of consciousness that I pour forth comes
    from within me but not as comparison but as observation.<br><br>This is an exercise
    in refinement because the goal is determined by the emerging context (which is
    to do with my own life), the guide is a point of focus and the emergence is the
    third connecting thread.  I have the ability to triangulate like this.  Many people
    don&#39;t come to the world this way and it would be foolish of me to say that
    this is a new way of doing things.  It is merely the way I am discovering that
    is best for myself.  <br><br>The joy of this journey isn&#39;t the emergence but
    the discovery of generous people.  When I read your comment Leland I could see
    the surprise and joy in it.  In everything that Mark Essel does, one cannot mistake
    his giving nature.  <br><br>Since the only given boundary on my online journey
    is the Disqus platform and where it can take me, I then must decide to navigate
    a careful pathway.  Not every Disqus destination is appropriate.  Some are too
    generic and without possibility, while some act as negative traps.<br><br>This
    journey outwards means that I am not restricted by the boundary of a blog site.  I
    am therefore a nomad and I can find new places.  The most interesting recently
    was at Crimson Harvard where I came across a 1950 article blogged as if it was
    1950 today:<br><br><b>Sorokin Article by Frank M. Gilbert</b> from March 17th,
    1950<br><a href="http://crimson-ws1.hcs.harvard.edu/article/1950/3/17/selfish-world-doomed-sorokin-says-after/"
    rel="nofollow">http://crimson-ws1.hcs.harvard.edu/article/1950...</a><br><br>I
    did not choose to go to the Crimson Harvard, instead the search I undertook was
    related to something else I was searching for that was applicable at that moment
    in time.  These are accidental connections that equate with an emergent journey.  So
    long as this journey is one about freedom and it isn&#39;t about identity or publicity
    - then I thoroughly enjoy the roving role of finding new destinations.<br><br>Mark
    Essel represents an established hub of this journey because of his tremendous
    open minded nature.  The irony here is that the more I explain of this journey
    I am undertaking the less emergent it becomes.  Therefore I do find that the more
    I define it the less I learn.  Yet whatever this journey becomes I have taken
    this opportunity to outline this not because you are from Korea and I really dig:<br><br><b>OhMyNews</b><br><a
    href="http://english.ohmynews.com/" rel="nofollow">http://english.ohmynews.com/</a><br><br>but
    because you are also key guest of Mark Essel.  After writing this note, I have
    to engage in a few grueling days in some work commitments but then on Friday,
    I will continue my online journey to whatever corner of the Internet it takes
    me.  <br><br>The fact that I don&#39;t get followed (or precisely don&#39;t want
    a following) is a blessing because that is not the nature of my own individual
    journey.  I do however most whole heartedly welcome people coming to Mark Essel&#39;s
    site because he has built a home on the web and it is that much more beautiful
    when it has intelligent and zestful or joyful guests.<br><br>Leland, as you can
    see I find it rather difficult to run out of words to express, so I think it is
    good for me to shut up at this given point and in a few days re-continue on my
    own particular online journey, in my own emergent and personally edifying manner
    :-)<br><br><b>[Em]</b>

  content: Wow Emeri... your words about needing to find the time for art and self-reflection
    struck a chord in me. Your ability to write is inspiring, to say the least. I
    hope you come back to join us in future discussions. :)<br><br>It was interesting
    that you brought up "ohmynews". I had the pleasure of meeting the editor-in-chief
    of that website face to face. Unfortunatly it was a very brief meeting and we
    didn&#39;t really discuss anything of note (I didn&#39;t know much about ohmynews
    before i met him) however. He was a very nice man. :)

  content: You&#39;re too kind, thanks Emeri. I learn so much from the comments here.
    I&#39;m glad it&#39;s a place you enjoy visiting and like a Bonzai tree I seek
    to cultivate a beautiful information sharing hub in the most important section
    of this blog, the comments. A space we share.

<p><em>Yesterday was a day of rest, relaxing, and recovery in Maui. I caught up with a few blog posts from friends while Michelle caught up on sleep. Here's my response to what's happening</em></p>
<h2>Links to Posts Mentioned</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/buzz/bslatkin/aBawa6jAzvL">Brett Slatkin thinks over Rising Tides</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/buzz/louisgray/XBSfRNyckg9/Must-There-Be-Opposition-in-All-Things-Im-Shutting">Louis Gray says no to negativity</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/buzz/dclinton/B4T3jEvKRMc/Louis-Grays-post-about-being-more-positive-http">Dewitt Clinton calls out spotty sources &amp; the Houdini trick of guessing motivations</a></p>
<h2>Spotty Sources &amp; Motivation Guessing</h2>
<p>There's a great difference between estimating and presuming knowledge of motivation. Estimating motivation is a fascinating challenge. And testing hypothesized rationale by comparing them to actions, is a method of learning. Matching behavior to motivation is a great way to understand people. And like it or not, blogs are a great sounding board to test hypotheses and get rapid feedback from other folks that share interests. I don't see motivational guessing going away anytime soon. But authors should certainly endeavor to make clear their estimated versus known motivations as a best practice.</p>
<h2>Louis is Sick of Negative Nancies</h2>
<p>Louis guzzles a flood of net info, and even with my much smaller draught I hit the negative wall fairly often. Whenever needed, I simply unplug from reading most sites for a few days and refresh my perspective. There's only so much tearing down you can put up with before it starts affecting the way you think. Louis wants to know what's happening without repeatedly running into buzzkills. See, I'm estimating Louis' motivations already.</p>
<h2>Rising Tides &amp; Network Economies</h2>
<p>After hundreds if not thousands of hours reading, brainstorming, <a href="{{ site.url }}/?s=Network+economy&amp;submit=Search ">writing</a> and dreaming about wealth, value, and information connectivity I'm a little past amateur in the area of network economies. My thinking here is heavily influenced by Kevin Kelly's New Rules for the New Economy. Businesses that foster and profit from increased network connectivity are poised to dominate the next several decades. The economy is certainly not a zero sum game. Competitive businesses that assume a zero sum economy artificially limit their potential to the ceiling of their presumed competitors. Winning business strategies will transcend short sighted ideologies, with massive benefits going to those who embrace and enrich their neighbors and master alignment with network growth.</p>
