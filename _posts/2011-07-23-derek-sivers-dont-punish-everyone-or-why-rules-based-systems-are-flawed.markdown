<p>Browsing <a href="http://knowabout.it">KnowAbout.it</a>'s email this morning I hit upon a video share from <a href="http://thinkvitamin.com/asides/dont-punish-everyone/">Think Vitamin</a>. </p>
<p>The premise is simple, reactionary rules that are put into place don't make the world a better place, they don't improve businesses, and they don't solve real problems.</p>
<p>I hope you appreciate it as much as I did.</p>
