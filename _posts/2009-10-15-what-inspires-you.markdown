  for Greatness</h1>\r\nSometimes we are forced to action. Other times we choose to
  act out of self interest or perceived benefit. But it is rare for us to take action
  that is truly inspired. When acting  with an inspired will, we are deliberate, conscious
  and fully aware of our lives. When inspired, we can overcome our own self imposed
  limits, and become greater than our self doubts. Simply witnessing a truly inspired
  person can have a dramatic cascading effect. Positive energy that emanates from
  an inspirational leader, kindles the spirits of those in close proximity. A harmony
  of emotional states becomes attuned to a single driving vision.\r\n\r\nA loose analogy
  can be made between the flow state of inspired working, and a hot streak in athletic
  activities. When I'm in the zone in racquetball every motion, swing and position
  sprint feels right. I'm not a strong player by any means, but my ability and movements
  flow much better at certain times. In these moments, I get the sense that my abilities
  are near their peak. It can be quite intoxicating to experience such a comfortable
  and easy rhythm of play. Thanks to my friend Tony for getting me to rediscover racquetball
  a few years back, it's great exercise and a lot of fun to play.\r\n\r\nBefore this
  post I called out to the <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/\">HackerNews</a>
  and <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/\">AskReddit</a> communities for
  their feedback."
