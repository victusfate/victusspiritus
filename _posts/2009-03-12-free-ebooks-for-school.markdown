<p>With the times being tougher many of us are going back to school, as well as the young folks that are going to college for the first time.&#0160; I was recently reminiscing about dollar veggie burgers and cheap living.&#0160; I&#39;m on a self started &quot;leave without pay&quot; and tightening the belt (I wish, put on a few pounds).&#0160; </p>
<p>Anyway I felt it was a good time to put together a new lens for&#0160;<a href="http://www.squidoo.com/eBooksForCollege">eBook College Textbooks</a> with some of the great sources for free, or cheaper textbook alternatives.&#0160; Professors appear to love printing new editions and forcing their students to buy them.&#0160; Not too long ago I also wrote up a site for <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/e-BookLibraries">Free eBook Libraries</a> so there was a good amount of correlation between the sites, making my job easier.</p>
