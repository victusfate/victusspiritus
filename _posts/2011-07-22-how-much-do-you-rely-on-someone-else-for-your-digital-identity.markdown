  content: That is rather interesting and I had not really considered that. I have
    so many digital links and backup links that I am not entirely sure how that would
    play out in my case. Some things, like Netflix, would still work fine but I would
    not get notifications. Other things might fail completely.

    Honestly, about a month or two after Google Docs came out I actually took the time to read the TOS.

    Strange, isn't it? It's not like I am a habitual TOS reader, but I guess at least subconsciously I thought about how much data I would have up there that I would at least like to retain sole ownership rights to even if it was public. When I saw I didn't even get that 'privilege' that is when I decided that I would have a multitude of services keeping my digital identity intact. Delicio.us, Photobucket &amp; Flickr, Dropbox, and other resources so instead of one 'storm' keeping all my data I have my own personal weather pattern. I have to admit I have not done a good job remembering or documenting the particular pattern of my Digital Online Presence, but reading about Dylan has make me think more and more about doing just that.

    Ive got phpMyID set up on my own domain and where possible, I authenticate using  that, but some sites demand a big name OpenID provider like gmail or yahoo. At the least I add my personal OpenID as an additional identity if a site allows that. 
    I have Thunderbird installed (via IMAP) and remember to occasionally fire ir up so that I have a local copy of my email.  I've managed to keep all my email since the 90s in this way despite having several different providers over the years. Using Thunderbird also makes it possible to use GnuPG (with the Enigmail plugin) since there is no easy way to use that with the web interface of gmail, and I wouldn't want to offer them my keys if there was. Since I have a way to compose encrypted email I can store sensitive personal data in the cloud without worrying about it too much.

    Some handy linkage is in order then!

    Thunderbird is free and easy to set up with gmail and runs on all the OS' I use:http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/

    I used to use MacPG for Mac (now its maintained by another group)
    http://www.gpgtools.org/
    but not sure if thats working on 10.7 yet

    Enigmail is a Thunderbird plugin and integrates the command line GPG tools into the Thunderbird GUI.

    will come in handy.

<p>At 3am I rolled over in bed and had a passing thought:</p>
<blockquote><p>
What if my gmail account was permanently inaccessible?
</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Update: this reportedly happens to folks on a regular basis, read <a href="http://consumerist.com/2011/07/google-deletes-last-7-years-of-users-digital-life-shrugs.html">Dylan's story</a> which is a mix of fabrication and truth</b></p>
<p>I use that email account as the ultimate key value store to the Internet. It is used as my login ID to a hundred or so different web services, and it's the backup address where any password change links are sent. In a very real way Google owns my digital identity and I rely on it as much or more than my government assigned social security number. </p>
<p>This passing thought is the primary motivation behind distributed identity systems such as OpenID. Anyone with a domain or unique url can leverage OpenID to provide a digital identity.</p>
<p>Without consideration, I casually added an <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/openid/">OpenID plugin</a> to this Wordpress powered blog last year. I wanted to see if I could log in as me at StackOverflow<sup><a href="#notes">1</a></sup>, and it worked as advertised. This year I'm going to make a concerted effort to shift my digital identity to one I own and control, and make <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com">VictusSpirtus.com</a> synonymous with other identities I have spread across the web. I suppose it's time for me to setup email through the domain as well (even if it's just forwarded to gmail).</p>
<p>Reliance on a single third party to verify who we are is another fractured piece of the digital identity puzzle. Late last year I commented on how <a href="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2010/12/22/internet-identity-is-broken/">Internet Identity is Broken</a>. It's surprising that we rely on something as fragile as our memory and an entity outside of ourselves to prove to other applications who we are. </p>
