  content: "[...] I&#8217;m neither a professional web developer, nor remotely a genius.
    What draws me to this domain is boundless opportunity and an open invitation to
    all who are willing to explore its beauty. I can learn from, collaborate, and
    eventually compete with incredibly focused and passionate entrepreneurs and artists.
    I can&#8217;t stress enough the importance of artistic design or social engineering
    in presenting an irresistible human interface to an app. I could spend a lifetime
    learning the nuances of elegant interface design, but I don&#8217;t have much
    time, I&#8217;m a founder first. [...]"

<h2>Sharpening Round Edges</h2>
<p><i>I'm not an engineer</I><br />
I'm a filthy hacker trying to Macgyver my way to a first product</p>
<p><I>I'm not a designer</I><br />
I desperately dream up just enough flow to keep folks from cursing at our stuff for 10 seconds </p>
<p><I>I'm not a psychologist</i><br />
I crawl cognitive posts to look for any leverage I can bake into a product. </p>
<p><I>I'm not a fan</I><br />
I ritually read through diverse sources of information for topics I need to know. I may deeply appreciate your words but when it comes down to it, you're work is a section in a personalized newspaper.</p>
<p><I>I'm not a friend</I><br />
Friends have their own agendas, their own lives, their own turmoil. I'm looking for partners, who's mutual survival is intertwined with my own.</p>
<p><I>I'm no author</I><br />
My thoughts are splashed here each day like a kid with a crayon. No mommy, no daddy, no tree, no house. Just startups, techniques and tools.</p>
<h2>I'm a Founder</h2>
<p>I'm all of the above, but I'm a Founder first. </p>
