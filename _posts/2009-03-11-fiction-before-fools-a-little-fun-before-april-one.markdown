<p><em>A segue from inspiration to imagination.</em>&#0160; <em>Hope you enjoy reading it as much as I did imagining it.</em></p>
<p>Their blades clash once more.&#0160; The thunderous echo of each impact, lash out with energies hinting at universal origin.&#0160; In all directions rings of hadronic rays cascade away from their duel.&#0160; They look like men, but are physically anything but human.&#0160; One of them is bald, clean shaven with sharp features and a slight hook nose, wearing a pristine silver business suit.&#0160; His name is Otho.&#0160; The other has medium length black hair growing straight up into tight bundles, each ending in a point, his face covered in stuble.&#0160; He&#39;s wearing a simple white button shirt and black slacks.&#0160; He is known as Victus.&#0160; Both of them wearing small rimmed metallic glasses with reflective lenses.&#0160; They move at relativistic speeds, their bodies consisting of super dense physiques responding to internal gravitic forces that would tear apart a black hole.&#0160; Their blades forged from pure Cronium curving with the speed each stroke.</p>
<p>The shock waves are tearing apart the very earth they stand upon.&#0160; The background shimmers and changes from a blacktop alley in a desolate ruin of a long forgotten city, to the surface of a moon.&#0160; The men seem unphased, as if they are coordinating the transformation.&#0160; Neither of them had need of air or heat for thousands of years.&#0160; The duel continues and on it goes for timescales man was never meant to perceive or endure through.&#0160; Galaxies collide, are born and wither and still the two duel.&#0160; Their blade impacts igniting new galactic formations.</p>
<p>Victus pauses for a moment noticing a nebula&#39;s glorious energy as they stand upon a small clearing near a lake one starry night.&#0160; It triggers a memory, and he dreams of an old companion.&#0160; She was spring to his soul.&#0160; This moment of distraction is all Otho needs.&#0160; Thousands of cuts followed by a succession of piercing jabs through his heart cause the great Victus to fall to the ground.&#0160; A moment later, the ultra dense neutron star like organic materials in his chest begin knitting back together, the scars seal up any trace of the wounds.&#0160; </p>
<p>Otho reaches out his hand to his old friend, &quot;Thinking about Trish again?&quot;</p>
<p>Victus accepts the offer, grasps Otho&#39;s hand, and stands once more.&#0160; &quot;I think we&#39;ve done enough damage for now&quot;, a warm but guilty smile crosses Victus&#39; face.&#0160; &quot;Let&#39;s get back before they miss us&quot;</p>
<p>Time and space bend before Otho as a gate appears, both gentlemen walk through to the sounds of a large dinner party...</p>
