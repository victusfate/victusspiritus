  content: "Hi Mark\n\nHmmm....you make it sound like you only make this decision
    once in life. For most not so.\n\nThe world is big and varied and wonderful and
    I'll bet you change as times do.\n\nWhy not search for what you want to do and
    find a place you both can do it and see what happens?\n\nCircumstances drive everything.
    And they continue to do so. \n\nOr at least that's what I see."

    My vote is for Gillette, NJ...I hear there's at least one kick-ass hacker there already...and the commute isn't so bad to the big bad NYC (plus there are tons of labs in the general area).

    I've been to Boulder and it's great...but the altitude is also something to think about there (def. go there before you commit to moving there -- while it didn't bother me, my wife pretty much had a headache the whole time we were in Boulder because of the altitude...you probably adjust to it if you live there though).

    SF is also great...but it's just as expensive as NYC, and in my opinion, even more 'clicque' focused...you can hook up with a startup for sure, but it doesn't mean you'll have any more fun or have any better quality of life (it's hard to move away from NYC and see an improvement in options for fun)...the weather is generally better though (if you don't mind the 8hour flight back and forth for family visits).

    I also spent a year down in NC (Greensboro) when I was younger...and though it doesn't have much of a startup scene, on all other fronts I would highly recommend it as an option...my plan is to eventually retire back down there (if we ever decide to leave the NYC area I mean)...

    The good news is that, no matter where you end up, the modern internet means you'll always be just a click away from the rest of us ;-)

  content: Good point. How mobile can we be, or do we wish to be is a better question.
    I like building long term friendships and doing so requires regular communication
    and interaction. Many of my childhood and college friends have all moved on to
    better opportunities and I get the sense that if I don't at least uproot a little
    now, I may never find the opportunity to do so.

    Hey if we move to Gillette that's two of us for a local hacker meetup. The trick for setting up a proper community outside of NYC is a perpendicular initial velocity which leads to a stable orbit so that the gravity well of Manhattan doesn't suck us in.

    How long is your commute in? Mine is about 1.5 hours now to Penn (drive to station, take ronkonkoma line in, driving can be faster or much much slower).

<p><I>Migration Patterns</I></p>
<p>Like many days before, I waited outside the mall where I walk each morning. An enormous flock of birds surged through the area, swimming by over half a minute. There's nothing more natural than moving to where life is more hospitable, and the flock was rapidly heading to warmer weather guided by habit and instinct. </p>
<p>With that in mind, my wife and I are strongly considering relocating to a new home. There are a few open questions and challenges to picking up, and moving tomorrow. </p>
<ul>
<li>Where's the best place to raise a family?</li>
<li>Where can we both find fantastic jobs? The economy's sucking isn't helping. Ideally there will be a strong hacker/builder community and plenty of awesome bio labs nearby</li>
<li>We'd like to be in reasonable range of our families. But a few hours away by car is comparable to a five hour flight across country. To balance distance, many vacations would be dedicated to visiting family if we move outside the area</li>
<li>We prefer a milder climate, warmer is better but killer humidity and heat are no good. I love walking and being outdoors 40-90 degrees Fahrenheit, Michelle enjoys being outdoors in the 50-80 degree temperature band</li>
</ul>
<p>Given those desired features we've narrowed the list down to a handful of locations in the US. We haven't looked internationally due to travel times to visit family. </p>
<p><i>The Bay Area</I></p>
<blockquote><p>
We've visited northern California twice this year. San Francisco was awesome in our first visit. Our second visit was down to San Jose. While Michelle was busy at the conference, I was on foot <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2010/11/18/net-fluctuations-in-san-jose-64kbps-to-23mbps/">searching for wifi</a> and <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2010/11/21/wrapping-up-the-silicon-valley-tour/">exploring the city</a>. I'd prefer living anywhere in the valley North West of San Jose, within easy commuting distance to San Francisco. Living in the city would be cool, but expensive and likely a longer commute depending on job location. </p>
<p>Public transportation was fine, and we don't mind driving. There are plenty of molecular bio labs in the valley, but to do clinical work Michelle will need a special certification (rough exam). Until then she could take on a challenging research lab position. Outside of the valley are gorgeous natural surroundings with Red Wood forests and an amazing coastal view. It's too cold to swim without a wetsuit but neither of us are beach junkies.
</p></blockquote>
<p><i>Boulder</I></p>
<blockquote><p>
While Boulder is on the cold side with mega snow, there's a dense culture that's startup/hacker friendly with plenty of bio labs in the area. It's a place we have yet to visit, so the odds of us moving out there are slim but it's still on the list. According to friends the outdoors stuff in the region is amazing, and it's a shorter flight back east or out west.
</p></blockquote>
<p><i>closer to New York City</I></p>
<blockquote><p>
Michelle has really been shining at her current job and I'm psyched to see her so happy. It could be a great place to grow a lasting career for her. Staying in the area means accepting local seasons where it's too cold in the winter and too hot/humid in the summer. But we're close to most of our family, and can use time off to travel wherever we want. </p>
<p>On my side Manhattan is having a surge of startups in the tech scene. But the companies are all small and vulnerable to a resurgence of the economy and the sucking sound of high paying wall street jobs. Manhattan could use a couple of big startups to draw in talent. The city has already succeeded in making sure <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2010/08/26/tech-startup-culture-is-spreading-and-contagious-but-not-on-long-island/">Long Island is a ghost town</a> when it comes to a startup community, by drawing people in.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Where will we end up migrating? We're not sure. I do know we're excited about building a great foundation for a family, and not afraid to move where life is more hospitable.</p>
