    First off... I like the new design! It's really rocking. ^^

    Secondly, isn't most competition semi-parasitic in nature anyways? Most competitors feed off of each other relentlessly.

    Good thoughts. :)

    While I''m far from that situation at the moment, it''s a concern I don''t wish
    to lose sight of. There''s also a significant role for parasitic entities in maintaining
    complex systems. '

  content: True enough. I think the word "parasitic" has too much of an automatically
    negative connotation. There are many, many parasites that make the biosphere work.

  content: I think there's something very interesting in this post, but it's not quite
    thought out completely. There's the beginning of a really worthwhile idea. Please
    do keep thinking about it and writing about it, I'd like to hear more - although
    I don't think it's quite ready as it is, since I don't fully understand it...
    What are you suggesting we need to do, or what are you suggesting will happen
    by itself? It would also help if you could point out some concrete examples of
    behaviour that you dislike.

  content: "I got caught up blending two concepts: social bureaucratic abilities and
    relationships which benefit one party more than the other - aka game theory on
    a broad scale. Appreciate the comment as it helped clarify the distinction Daniel.\n\nThere
    are different types of business relationships which mimic the relationships between
    organisms. In a highly liquid market relationships are symbiotic, as choice converges
    on optimal exchange rates. Parties interact because the exchange is a net benefit.
    The opportunity cost of not participating is difficult to balance against receiving
    slightly less than the practical market will bear, so for the most part we opt
    in. \n\nIn an illiquid market discrepancies emerge between supply and demand.
    There exists a stabilizing market force which consists of those who perceive an
    opportunity for imbalance and are then able to capitalize on it by providing a
    measure of liquidity, and taxing that exchange.\n\nI dislike heavy handed manipulation
    through legislation and artificial illiquidity. It's the legal equivalent of protections
    fees, or theft. An example of this is eminent domain. Other examples are legislation
    which prohibits or severely hampers potential competition. Another specific case
    of opportunism are investors who demand outlandish terms in order to approve a
    deal. There are additional rules which restrict qualified investors to a few wealthy
    individuals, providing access to entrepreneurial investment only through large
    brokerages and funds."

  content: Ah, I think I see what you're saying now... Another concept you might want
    to throw in there is that of information asymmetries. In my experience, those
    drive parasitic behaviour more than market liquidity (but then I haven't thought
    about the liquidity angle). Perhaps they go hand in hand, even. Certainly when
    information about price is difficult to come by, no matter how easy it is to make
    the actual sale (i.e. how liquid), someone will parasite the transaction...

<p>The relationships between organisms are categorized as symbiotic when species cooperate, and parasitic when one organism feeds off the energy, labor and life-force of another. Nature is not inclined to morally judge the tactics of life, the only law is survival and procreation. Over time ecosystem and environmental instabilities shift even the most successful life forms and relationships into chaos, rewarding only the most fit and fortunate with another sunrise. Parasitic organisms have survived for hundreds of millions of years, and there is little doubt that their presence plays a vital role in maintaining healthy ecosystems.</p>
<p>As rational beings, humanity has erected volumes of our own laws to complement those of nature. We have developed complex systems of governance and ownership to manage the flow of resources and reward labor based on its perceived social value. For us fitness criteria extend well beyond physical, mental, and social health. </p>
<p>Our success and very survival are tied to an increasingly important ability to navigate complex social structures far removed from close personal bonds. I'll label these meta-traits <b>systematic perception</b> and <b>influence or manipulation</b>, depending on the situation^. This combination of talent and skill reveals countless opportunities to profit from others' labor with limited personal effort*. It also enables manipulation of the existing social hierarchy to extract optimal personal value. </p>
<p>The result is a parasitic relationship, where one party enjoys a disproportionate share of value from the majority of their exchanges. This is not merely a case of huge leverage and fees. Even if the discrepancy is minute per exchange, when scaled to millions or billions of transactions, a significant margin is recognized.</p>
<p><I>The Counter to Parasitic Growth is Competition</I></p>
<p>Beyond direct competition, which only leads to more efficient parasitic behavior, there's a force which diminishes market wide systematic opportunities, and efficient markets naturally trend towards this state (not to be confused with equilibrium). <br />
<a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2011/02/12/startup-strategies-that-survive-prosper-and-win/">Commoditizing the complement</a> is a well understood tactic for startups and mature businesses, at least <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html">Joel</a> and <a href="http://cdixon.org/2009/12/30/whats-strategic-for-google/">Chris</a> seem to think so. Why not extend this strategy to dissuade parasites from specific fields by decreasing their margins to zero. If your market is paying an 8% liquidation tax (relative size of financial industry to the US GDP) or a loan with a 10,000% interest rate over 5 years, it's a perfect time to collaboratively create and contribute to low cost alternatives. Ultimately the market will judge the quality of your labor without hesitating. Is it beneficial, additive, multiplicative, or a necessary parasitic force.</p>
<p>I'm not suggesting that life should be fair, and that everyone should enjoy equal wealth and health. <br />
I don't belief value is equitably created or distributed, nor is wealth creation a zero sum game. Our time may be spent on creating nascent value through directed effort or siphoning value from others. </p>
<p>That said not all efforts are productive, and even the best intentions don't guarantee the creation of value, let's not forget gratuitous errors in judgement or lady luck.  </p>
<p>Notes:<br />
^= Trek fans can just call it being a Ferengi</p>
<p>*= Personal effort is an admittedly subjective term. I would discount the herculean effort of sitting up all night dreaming up schemes and chatting online, while your <del>team</del> hosts painstakingly breathe life into a business that fulfills a real social need. Yet I have profound respect for leaders and hustlers who get their hands dirty.</p>
