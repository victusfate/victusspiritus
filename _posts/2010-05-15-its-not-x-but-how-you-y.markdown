  content: What&#39;s not? The importance? <br><br>In answer to each:<br><br>I&#39;m
    going to your wedding. I&#39;m taking Spirit Airlines, and then the LIRR. To me,
    the important part is where I&#39;m going.<br><br>I can&#39;t answer on my invented
    tech, but how tech is used is closely related to what it is.<br><br>Treating your
    team and customers is a big part, to be sure, but is you&#39;re building a pile
    of pine-cones, I doubt your treatment will carry you through it.<br><br>money..
    helps make your life rich. You can do some fantastic things with money that you
    couldn&#39;t without it. -- poor man Lid<br><br>automated filtering.. shows care
    for customers.. :)<br><br>As for what you understand, sure, if you&#39;re a teacher,
    but if you want to use that knowledge, rather than pass it on, then the understanding
    itself seems more important.<br><br>"Itâ€™s not what you say, but how you listen"
    What if you&#39;re a guest speaker in a lecture hall? <br><br>Hehe, sorry to be
    mean about your post. I understand that it wasn&#39;t intended as an argument,
    but just some nice words. I guess I&#39;m trolling a bit :)

  content: Hey if we agreed on our opinions all the time what fun would discussions
    be, troll on Eli :)<br>The one liners represent style ideals I&#39;d like to live
    by. Your life perspective has yielded a powerful counter view.  <br><br>Guest
    speakers that listen well are generally better speakers. Focusing on speaking
    alone wouldn&#39;t get them very far.<br><br>Automated filtering detached from
    care about input sources and the attention of readers has little value.<br><br>A
    pile of pine cones could be a profound statement if all the world leaders met
    to do so. But it&#39;s not about the pine cones. The focus is about working together
    in a healthy way. The wisdom of specific activities is up to each group.<br><br>I
    agree that there needs to be a lower level of resource based wealth before the
    quality of our lives can be improved. But after a certain comfortable survival
    level financial wealth drops in importance compared to satisfaction and happiness.
    We quickly adjust to new wealth levels as the norm.<br><br>How you get there refers
    to all the nuances of the journey. For your example, working as a census collector
    for a couple of weeks in order to fly out, is part of how you get here. It&#39;s
    important. On that note where & when are you flying in? Email me, don&#39;t take
    LIRR, I&#39;ll pick you up.

    This post is a helpful reminder  to me of the big picture.
