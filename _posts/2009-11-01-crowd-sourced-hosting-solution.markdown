excerpt: "*edit* <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">We opted for Rackspace for their

  a quick search and spending a few minutes reading about cloud services like <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\">EC2</a>
  ($60-70/month minimum) and <a href=\"http://www.rackspacecloud.com/cloud_hosting_products/servers\">Rackspace</a>
  ($11+/month) I decided these solutions may have features I'm looking for, but may
  not be optimal at this time.  If all goes well they may be on our scaling trajectory.\r\n\r\nMy
  default choice is Rackspace's Cloud offering without more knowledge. But I'm interested
  in listening to some folks smarter than myself in this area, in hopes they'll share
  their experiences with web hosting (good, bad, features, restrictions). I use <a
  href=\"http://www.hostmonster.com/\">Hostmonster</a> for this blog (and <a href=\"http://www.victusmedia.com\">Victus
  Media</a>), but the ssh access I have gives me limited ability to install certain
  must have utilities (permissions problems)."

<h1>Google Wave Request for Hosting Selection</h1>
<p>[wave id="googlewave.com!w+9xEnpOw0A"]</p>
<p>Several <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/search?q=hosting">AskReddit questions</a> shed some additional light on what people look for and expect in hosting companies. The range of support goes from a simple web site host, to a fully functional and scalable compute server with web facing options.</p>
