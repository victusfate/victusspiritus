  in the cognitive ability to use juxtapositional thinking (JT) for complex design
  work (general complex level of thinking/problem solving). But apparently the great

  News</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/\">subreddit programming</a>

  ducky at this very moment, and I'm doing my best to remain in the writing flow ;))"

  content: That&#39;s a peroonal issue for me, you want to be stressed about one thing,
    your work ,in such a way where you are focused.  If you are so stressed about
    so many things, it won&#39;t happen.  I did college in such a way where my life
    was, well my life was not mine purely (I had a lot to sort out, and still do,
    such is the price of being young, and at least I am willing to pay that price,
    I know plenty of people who put it aside for many other things in life)<br>If
    your life cards are not in order there will be no flow state- you won&#39;t have
    the opportunity for it.

<h2>Can We Learn How to Ignore or Overcome Stress?</h2>
<p>Alan mentioned that select individuals he has worked with or known, don't have the normal neurological response to stress that most others do. These high performers seemed undaunted in their ability to wield juxtapositional thinking to solve difficult problems. My hypothesis is that any of us can learn how to better cope with stress in regards to juxtapositional thinking. Simply by training our response to interruptions, we can increase our mental state's "durability". Instead of focusing our complete attention on a ringing phone, co-worker's visit, or barking dog we simply give them only our most automated attention and continue to maintain a high functioning mental state. The task requires us to practice a form of working meditation where we acknowledge distractions but don't over react to their presence. Obliviousness may be the apparent social characteristic of practicing this form of cognitive training, but it's important to be open with your co-workers, associates or friends. Communicate that you are not ignoring them so much as training your ability to achieve extended periods of juxtapositional thinking.</p>
<p>There's also strong correlation with the <a href="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2009/07/03/human-condition-flow-is-action-experiencing/">flow state</a>, an optimal working state of mind, and a stronger tolerance to stress interruptions to JT. In the flow we project our positive state of minds outwards to those around us. We do this by action, mannerisms, and conversational tones. In this way we can help induce others into a JT state of mind by reducing stress in the lucrative effort of building <a href="http://the-programmers-stone.com/about/">gelled teams</a>.</p>
