  content: Mark, here&#39;s my take on the success of these browser based games.<br><br>Firstly,
    as you said they are tapping into a growing audience. But more then that, they
    are also tapping into a previously untapped time block. Before browser based low-resource
    cost games, people at work were forced to play things like poker/chess/etc...
    on yahoo or whatnot to kill time. However, those older games never had the viral
    channels and social "hooks" that these new social based games do.<br><br>The combination
    of viral channels for bringing in new players (facebook updates and game invitations
    from friends), gift economy based game structure (using reciprocal gift giving
    motivation to keep players buying and giving back to their friends), low barrier
    of entry (even work computers can play these games) and universal access (almost
    any device that exists can play the game) all come together to create the perfect
    game to waste company time on. <br><br>If you looked at how much work productivity
    these games cost companies across the globe, we would be looking at eight figures
    or more. Browser based games are also easier to hide from a surprise visit from
    the boss. :)<br><br>And finally, even though farmville has a huge amount of players,
    they have no brand/game loyalty whereas World of Warcraft creates many barriers
    to players switching to different games and virtual worlds.<br><br>To be honest,
    I am sickened by the psychological tactics Blizzard and Zynga games uses on their
    players. If you take a step back, look at the inputs and outputs and see the games
    for what they really are (an elaborate attention trap), you will see how much
    effort these companies put towards trapping players. It is reflected in every
    choice they make. <br><br>I recently spent some time researching the psychological
    principles that exist behind peoples&#39; motivation for buying virtual items,
    things that do not have any existence in the real world. I posted some info about
    that awhile back when we were talking about ... something. Sorry I can&#39;t remember
    exactly. :)<br><br>Anyways it all boils down to the fact that the operator of
    a virtual world, as opposed to the real world, can absolutely control the realities
    of people who reside in that virtual world. The operator, in the interests of
    profit, will:<br><br>1. Control the boundaries of achievement that players can
    reach for (mudflation)<br>2. Create artificial scarcities to keep players hooked
    (artificial rarity of items, time and utility)<br>3. Continuously introduce new
    ways for high-ranked players to flaunt the time that they wasted inside of the
    virtual world (this makes my blood boil, as it is directly playing with our natural
    motivation to desire a higher social position to our fellow man... but in the
    end, this is just an illusion created by the game designer to keep his players
    addicted)<br>4. Periodically destroying existing social structures and values
    (this allows newer users to have the carrot lowered closer to their face, increasing
    the amount of new people coming into the system)<br>5. Exploiting outside events
    and movements from the real-world and other virtual worlds (for example, special
    clothing that says "I hate BP" on the front.. in the virtual world)<br><br>If
    you apply these 5 principles when looking at a social game or virtual game world
    like World of Warcraft, the actions behind changes in the system will become transparent.<br><br>It
    is just a money grab and an attempt to addict as many people as possible. The
    days of game designers making a game "just for entertainment" are reaching an
    all-time point.<br><br>I hope this didn&#39;t turn into a rant, but I have very
    strong feelings about bending peoples&#39; psychology like this in order to turn
    them into slaves to the game.<br><br>This is why World of Warcraft creates suicide
    in rare cases.

  content: Although I overplayed and saw WoW the same way. We can&#39;t discount that  <br>some
    folks use it for entertainment & fun. Tied up with all day  <br>bachelor party
    (hang out with old friends here for the wedding), I&#39;ll  <br>keep posting but
    will have tiny windows to comment (my favorite part)  <br>until mid June

<p>A brief conversation with my visiting friend Eli Sacks has lead to a review of the state of online gaming and what directions it may take in the future. We both have been long time PC gamers although in the past year my game time has moved to the console. </p>
<p>One of the breakthroughs we saw last year was browser based games exploding in popularity. A much wider audience has found the experience of socializing over games to be a great way to keep in touch with friends while having fun. To put the viral growth of social gaming into perspective check out these numbers. The most popular MMORPG World of Warcraft's in it's hayday had over 10 million people playing the game. Compare that to a  "FarmVille has become the most popular game application on Facebook, with over 82.4 million active users and over 23.9 million Facebook application fans in May 2010" (<a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FarmVille?wasRedirected=true">source</a>). While Warcraft charges a much higher premium ($15/month) app based browser games charge for virtual goods and have almost no barrier to entry. The appeal of fast viral success of social gaming is attracting <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FarmVille?wasRedirected=true">skilled developers in droves</a></p>
<h2>Where games can go from here</h2>
<p>While something as extravagant as World of Warcraft is not available through a browser today a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mulitplayer_browser_games">growing list of games</a> have been successfully porter to browsers. We can expect improved social, browser based games as the market demand grows. Location based and augmented reality games will also have wide appeal to social gamers, as they bring games outiside of the PC and into other aspects of our lives. Finally crowd developed content for games is becoming a powerful vector for entertainment. Successful social games will take the most passionate players and enable them to rapidly contribute to richer game experiences. </p>
