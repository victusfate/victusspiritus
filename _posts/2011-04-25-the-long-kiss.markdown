<h2>Pain</h2>
<p>No small thing is taken for granted, after anguish we marvel at what was assumed and invisible. Never underestimate the clarity and focus of pain.</p>
<h2>Judgement</h2>
<p>Discerning taste is matured through seasoning. Sampling unsavory concoctions sharpens perception of quality in all things.</p>
<h2>Age</h2>
<p>Delightful wine's flavor is refined with age, for the connoisseurs who fancy it. </p>
<p>Adoration for enchanting music grows with each listening until the sounds become stale. Thankfully we never tire of a few precious melodies.</p>
<h2>Experience</h2>
<p>Can you confidently identify what bears reinforcing versus what is better forgotten with only a sideways glance, a passing touch, a single taste? Swim deeply in life's ocean of treasures and share its secrets with cherished friends.</p>
