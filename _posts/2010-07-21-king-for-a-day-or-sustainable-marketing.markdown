  content: and per the context :) I have no idea what the deal is with Old Spice (except
    that my dad used, maybe still does, their aftershave) - and haven&#39;t seen any
    of the videos (which is why I tried using your link) ... all I can say is that
    you Americans seem to have waaaay too much free time on your hands!

  content: Link finally works. <br><br>And yeah we have free time in abundance with
    current unemployment rates :(. <br>I&#39;m working on getting just one lifetime
    of it for myself. Or at least more self directed time (with adequate income to
    live well).

  content: Darnit. That&#39;s what copy pasting from a notepad app into the android
    wordpress is doing to my links. I&#39;ll have to be more careful when typing them
    in. Appreciate the heads up.

  content: Thanks again, it was the first <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2010/07/17/first-post-from-android-a-taste-of-freedom/"
    rel="nofollow">android post</a>. When copying in the text it appends an extra
    a href tag in front of the a href and defaults with a link to the page/post you&#39;re
    on.<br><br>Really appreciate your help pointing it out.

  content: maybe time isn&#39;t the right word ... <br><br>but, seriously, can you
    see or imagine how it may looks like from other places on the planet? It seems
    to me self-absorbed, petty and detached from the world that so much attention
    can be diverted to something like Old Spice ... <br><br>maybe it&#39;s just me
    ....

  content: I&#39;m a big fan of creativity, in all it&#39;s forms*. The videos are
    just one more format. Comedy is a risky field. You can&#39;t repeat yourself too
    often or you become boring. Writers and comedians are always pushing the limits
    of what&#39;s funny. The greatest comedians can challenge us to think.<br><br>These
    old spice commercials are just unexpected combinations of ideas merged together
    and just strike a funny bone (at least for me). <br><br>I hope people all over
    the world have all the time they need to create and experience each others creations.<br><br>*

  content: 'I usually stay away from all things having to do with marketing and advertisement,
    but admit: this campaign caught my attention too. And especially the back-story
    ( I&#39;ve read it on read-write-web, similar to your link <a href="http://creativity-online.com"
    rel="nofollow">creativity-online.com</a>).<br><br>It is rare that big ad-companies
    are letting their creative talent go &#39;unchecked&#39; and even more rare, that
    clients are ok with it. <br><br>I was thinking all the time (2-3 days) "how long
    can they go on, before it backfires?" and that was the second thing that was astounding
    to me: they stopped. They had the balls to end it, instead of milking it for maybe
    weeks or months, like they could have done easily. Shows how really smart they
    are?<br><br>Will it have an impact? I don&#39;t know myself. I never understood
    advertisement and their &#39;numbers&#39;. But I sure like my uncles favorite
    after shave getting such attention. :)'

  content: I am absolutely sure it will have an impact. The writing is amazing, they
    present a clear and actionable reason for using old Spice vs their competitors
    and they use humor to support their reasoning.<br><br>This is one of the best
    examples of marketing I have seen recently.

<p>Do writers recognize when their work is going to catch on like wild fire? The recent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLTIowBF0kE">Old Spice</a> viral video series has caused a wave of gut busting chaos induced hilarity.The strangest realization for me is that I was already a customer (since 1996) and hadn't realized it. As I watched and listened to <a class="zem_slink" title="Isaiah Mustafa" rel="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2390461/">Isaiah Mustafa</a> state "Silverfish Handcatch" for the 6th time I realized that I use Old Spice as an underarm deodorant. But I'd never swap because of a funny video and Old Spice aftershave sucks ;).</p>
<p>I've gotta tip my hat to one hell of a project marketing team. The combination of over the edge writing and actor execution/presenceÂ  made for an irresistible watch. These guys killed it. As a follow on they made comment response videos exploding in popularity after Digg founder Kevin Rose's get well video response (staged?) and share on twitter. Pro technique to sustain a few viral videos into a series.</p>
<p>While the writers could be working on Saturday Night Live or other films I can't believe their amazing effort will result in a sustained boost to product sales. In the short term their efforts will be profitable for Old Spice, but folks will quickly return to their favorite after shaves and under arm deodorants. Maybe some won't and that's more than the cost of the video campaign?</p>
<p>Update:<br />
This <a href="http://creativity-online.com/news/behind-the-work-old-spice-responses/144947">Behind the World: Old Spice Responses</a> interview captures the production process and how the team pulled it all together so quickly. It was a strategic campaign with creative folks working 3 days straight.</p>
