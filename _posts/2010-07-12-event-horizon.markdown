  content: The plot of Event Horizon wasn&#39;t that great, but it had some great
    effects.

  content: It was amplified quite a bit when my good friend Ben and I watched it early
    on a Saturday after shrugging off a night of drinking. I can still remember the
    jarring sounds of doors closing and camera work. I thought it was very well produced.<br><br>Plus
    it got bonus points for being wtf hellraiser-ish.<br><br>To each his own :D

<blockquote>Miller: Oh. My. God. What happened to your eyes?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Dr. Weir: Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Miller: What are you talking about?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Dr. Weir: I created the Event Horizon to reach the stars, but she's gone much, much farther than that. She tore a hole in our universe, a gateway to another dimension. A dimension of pure chaos. Pure... evil. When she crossed over, she was just a ship. But when she came back... she was alive! Look at her, Miller. Isn't she beautiful?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Miller: Your "beautiful" ship killed its crew, Doctor.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Dr. Weir: Well... now she has another crew. Now she has us.</p></blockquote>

<h2>The Point of No Return</h2>
<p>An event horizon is the boundary from within no matter or even light itself can escape the seductive pull of a black hole*.  We've all felt the gravity of important life changing decisions, you know the ones that really matter as opposed to the ones <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/tag/decision-making/">we think matter</a>. There's a moment right after the decision where we question the choice made, but realize it's already too late to go back, we've crossed the event horizon.</p>
<p>Without event horizon's in our life we'd constantly be taking <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulligan_(games)">mulligans</a> or be distracted by the opportunity to replay painful mistakes in hopes of creating a better outcome. This is no way to live. And fortunate for us this isn't the way the world works despite our mind's haunted visions telling us otherwise.</p>
<p>Should we always burn the bridge behind us?</p>
<p>What if we need to step back or is revisiting old choices already a mistake?</p>
<p>Aren't they new choices given a change of circumstances?</p>
<p>There's little doubt <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2009/07/01/decision-making/">we make our best decisions</a> with a fresh mental state. In the simplest cases you can see how many people strive for a zero inbox by performing a search. Almost 3 million web pages come up for zero inbox. How about white boards, is yours cluttered or clean? Look at your desktop, are there distractions waiting to draw just a fragment of your attention away from the important stuff? A little mental house cleaning goes a long way, and it's a large part of why I blog each morning. Dumping my mind's cache so that I'm ready for a new problem to tackle.</p>
<p><em>The backstory of this post is a good friend of mine who's going through a rough spot. After he revisited the charming movie that this post is titled after, he's come to see the film as a tragic love story about Dr. Weir (Sam Neill) dealing with the loss of his wife.</em></p>
<p>Notes:<br />
* = that's not quite true. Black holes have polar radiation of very high energy photons and this emission eventually leads to the end of the gravity well</p>
