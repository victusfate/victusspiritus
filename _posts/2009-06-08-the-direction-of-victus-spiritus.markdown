  writing up the following in a brief message to fellow blogger <a href=\"http://www.qrimp.com/blog/profiles.Randall.html\">Randall</a>
  (recently discovered both of us perceive a similar near future). I thought it best
  to share the direction I'll be taking the blog over the next few months with VS
  community members (aka readers/commenters, you).\r\n\r\n"

  content: Shame on me for posting this bullet wall, seriously it looks like this
    post leaves something to be desired after hearing from you and catfishwaehner
    (on reddit).   I did it as a courtesy (to anyone who stops in the blog, they deserve
    at least as much), and as a guide for myself to remember which way I want to take
    the blog.

  content: I... upvoted it. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with the
    post, but I wanted to point out that your bullet points have sub-bullet points.

  content: Thanks Eli.  It&#39;s probably best to keep "where&#39;s this blog going"
    posts off of public crowd sourcing sites.  New readers will have the same reaction
    as catfishwaehner.

<p>After writing up the following in a brief message to fellow blogger <a href="http://www.qrimp.com/blog/profiles.Randall.html">Randall</a> (recently discovered both of us perceive a similar near future). I thought it best to share the direction I'll be taking the blog over the next few months with VS community members (aka readers/commenters, you).</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-521"></a></p>
<p>Just a heads up for the topics I like to study/concentrate on/write about:</p>
<ul>
<li>business efficiency, productivity philosophies
<ul>
<li>#1 matching our work with what we love to do, but generally how I'll run my company... TBD</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>communication (social media, one to many, many to many)</li>
<li>social collaborative design (tools, areas of interest)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd like to see what Google wave can do for the last 2 (communication/collaborative design) or better yet what I can do with Google wave.</p>
<p>Some things I'd like to learn and write more about:</p>
<ul>
<li>emergence software concepts
<ul>
<li>huge systems of simple tools from which incredibly complex applications emerge</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>semantic tools
<ul>
<li>language analysis tools</li>
<li>optimality of communication</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>prime factorization
<ul>
<li>prediction</li>
<li>numerical features</li>
<li>information compression possibilites</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>open software initiatives:  can we pattern a similar structure that somehow rewards developers based on contributions (credit, money)?  The challenges include:
<ul>
<li>fair attribution for work done</li>
<li>project management/focus</li>
<li>laying out virtual landing pages/hooks for developers to discover and sink their teeth into</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
