  content: Google has built a very viable competitor to the iPhone in under 2 years.
    The growth rate of the Android platform (and number of devices that run it) is
    truly stunning.<br><br>In another 2 years time I think we will see a near identical
    market share percentage.<br><br>Just my 2c.<br><br><a href="http://www.nexusoneforum.net"

    cogent argument for stopping development for the iPhone, until you said "For me
    it comes down to user experience"

    experience considered poor form? That&#39;s all I think about when developing

  content: Goodbye and farewell.  I&#39;d like to say you will be truly missed, but
    you won&#39;t.  It&#39;s the wisest thing you can do.  You&#39;re a rebel. Master
    of your own domain.  Free as the wind.  No walled-garden for you.  The iPhone
    platform will be rock solid a year from now and Android will be a fragmented and
    splintered platform.  So many variants of smartphone from so many different companies.  Good
    luck with that.<br><br>Apple wants to make things as simple as possible for all
    the millions of users on their mobile platform.  To protect and serve.  Nice motto,
    huh.

    in the wild and uncontrolled space of the web?<br><br>I hear your argument, Apple
    is buiding something very attractive. A mobile web where I don&#39;t have to worry
    about the details. That&#39;s pretty powerful. But I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s
    a winning strategy. <br><br>An interesting read on the network economy, is New

  content: '"Apple wants to make things as simple as possible for all the millions
    of users on their mobile platform. To protect and serve. Nice motto, huh."<br><br>Simple
    isn&#39;t better in this case. They remove choices and act as our parent, and
    we get enough of that from the government without inviting companies to do it
    for us. <br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think they offer a choice: the choice
    to live with their authority over us, or not. I think they have the right to do
    this, and would not want to stop them. I would also not want to use their service.
    <br><br>We should not be so complacent with others deciding for us. If they had
    some options set by default, but these options were easily changed, that would
    be one thing. Disallowing their customers from running various unapproved applications
    and only letting them use one service provider doesn&#39;t protect anyone but
    themselves. They can suggest only using their approved apps, and they could suggest
    using one service provider or another, but taking away our options does not serve
    us. <br><br>I disagree with Mark that this kind of practice should be disallowed,
    but, I also think that Microsoft should have been allowed to bundle IE into their
    OS. The reason is: we can choose not to accept this authority. Why would people
    be so willing to embrace more authority in their lives? When I buy a piece of
    hardware, I am supposed to be the super user of that hardware. This may be a tired
    old concept, but it makes sense.'

  content: I think at the time the EU started the case the competition (Netscape)
    had no chance because Microsoft was on a huge majority of pcs (98%) and was leveraging
    it&#39;s presence with manufacturers to not ship with competing browsers.

  content: history repeats and the strong leadership of Jobs is showing its hand.
    this is no doubt the beginning of the end for iPhone (and iWhatever) domination.
    but the decline will be slow and long and Apple will make a ton of profits along
    the way and give many a very useful platform. so what me worry?<br><br>and then
    Apple&#39;s recent announcement "Apple Puts Ban on Location-Based iPhone Apps".
    yikes, what are they thinking? its a rhetorical question folks. they want to keep
    that revenue for themselves. more of the same sort of closed thinking. <br><br>its
    all for the best - for Apple. i find the comments here defending Apple to be quite
    amusing. its a war of the believers against the heretics. nothing more. peeps,
    its important to know who your friends are, Apple is not one of them. they are
    simply using you.<br><br>tho i do agree that simple is good and Apple is the master
    in that regard. to each their own.

  content: I have tried neither the iPhone nor android...I guess I am a little behind
    the times. I like my Blackberry, it&#39;s new to me and I will see if I enjoy
    the experience in the long run.<br><br>I like your views, Mark. I am a sprint
    customer so I am effectively locked out of the iPhone market. It still looks neat,
    and if I were planning on moving to AT&T with my wireless I would consider it.<br><br>I
    had a choice to go for an android phone, but price was a major factor for me and
    I could get my Curve for much cheaper. I wonder how the android and the blackberry
    match up?

  content: Heyo Terence!<br>I know my friend at work swapped from a blackberry to
    a droid and was very pleased. What was the price difference? If I buy an unbound
    phone (better to get the discount and leave in 3 months) it&#39;s pricey. I did
    that with my iPhone 3Gs but it might be cheaper to get the subsidy and jump to
    another plan. One day smart phones will be super cheap and data will be near free,
    but we&#39;re not quite there yet.

<p><em>*update* I've got a pretty solid setup now with a wifi only iphone 4. I couldn't beat the typing interface for my daily writing. I haven't found a need to  unlock it yet.<br />
</em></p>
<ol>
<li>iPhone is a fundamentally closed architecture. Sure lots of developers are working through the store to get access to a large market, but the store's cut isn't the only tax. Apple is the gatekeeper and has proven that it will block competition. For examples see Skype &amp; Google Voice. Additionally the approval time for updates is too slow, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/apple.html">taking weeks or more</a></li>
<li>Web apps are much more appealing alternative for developers who want the biggest market without having to rewrite the same app for multiple architectures. I recognize that web apps don't have full access to the device hardware. Expect this trend to change rapidly</li>
<li>I'm not the administrator on my own hardware (without jailbreaking) which is a pita without a mac. Software apps or Apple can push updates I don't want. Jailbreaking an Android is trivial by comparison. Being in the drivers seat of my own hardware destiny matters to me</li>
<li>No choice of data provider. Put aside the debate of <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2010/01/10/metaprotocols-minimize-restrictions-on-communication-network-evolution/">dumb pipes</a>, AT&amp;T vs Verizon vs Sprint vs Tmobile. Choice is the foundation of competition. I want businesses competing ferociously to be my mobile web service provider. I want the mobile Net commodotized and absolutely transparent. Providers should be dynamic not static, the cheapest bit wins</li>
<li>iTunes doesn't work on Linux. Sure I can get wine to emulate windows and the push the iPod patch and it may work (it flaked on my setup) but why should I have to?</li>
<li>For the same reason Microsoft was a monopoly for integrating their crappy Internet Explorer browser Apple should have to decouple their store from their hardware. Let me buy through whoever I want (go Magnatune &amp; Last.fm!). I admit IE has gotten better since they were forced to decouple their web browser from the OS. Competition is a good thing for users/customers and the stability of businesses</li>
<li>For me it comes down to user experience. I'd much prefer a solid under the hood infrastructure and choice of windowing/interface environmet. It's why Ubuntu flavored Linux is working great for me. If only I could slap that on my mobile...</li>
</ol>
<p>Things that no mobile provider has official support for but it should be the defaut:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tethering. One monthly bill for all my data usage (4G I'm looking at you). No special tax for voice or SMS colored data or cost multipliers because I have a laptop or desktop at home. $70/month for fat bandwidth is more than enough to cover my data needs. I shouldn't have to lay $80-110 per device or an extra $50 for a landline</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a followup to <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2009/08/01/apple-att-are-pulling-a-thelma-and-louise/">Apple and AT&amp;T are pulling a Thelma &amp; Louise</a>.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I don't hate Apple, I've enjoyed my iPhone mobile for a few years for the Net access it has given me (2G and 3Gs). My fiancé Michelle had a wonderful experience setting up her iMac.</p>
