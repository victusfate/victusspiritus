  content: Very well said Mark. I too share jealousy, respect and concern for almost
    the same exact reasons. But I wish them well, gave them some money and hope to
    have a product that I can use, modify and contribute to. Will it be a Facebook-killer?
    No, but it gives us new alternatives or compliments today&#39;s centralized apps.
    <br><br>As I said to Matt Asay yesterday, I would love to see a "Boxee Box" or
    "PogoPlug" styled appliance that you attach a USB hard drive to and magically
    become a seed or personal hub. If businesses can have appliances and internal
    clouds, why can&#39;t consumers?

  content: I&#39;m not exactly jealous, maybe a little bit, but it&#39;s just that
    they look like art-students rather than computer scientists. They got the funding,
    but there are issues that make what they are attempting to achieve even harder
    than trying to gather users to an open service. They seem to want users to have
    control of the physical seed, which isn&#39;t going to help in seeing adoption.
    They could actually handle this without having to have physical seeds, as it&#39;s
    been done before, in several of the distributed systmes. My personal favorite
    is an Open FF POC form for real-time, PSHB, distributed interaction, <a href="http://www.socnode.org/dev"
    rel="nofollow">http://www.socnode.org/dev</a>.<br><br>I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll see
    something come from them, but will it be something that people will use, is my
    biggest question. I just don&#39;t see a general consumer moving towards, this,
    they&#39;ll be grabbing early-adopters first, but even then adoption will be lower.
    Until they get a turnkey service opened, the success of the project is limited.
    Though what Manielse said about the usb appliance, would make it greatly simpler,
    they seem to want full-fledged machines.

  content: Hi Mark<br><br>Respect I get...the test of success, early on for an entrepreneur
    is just moving the needle in some way...funds or prototype or support. <br><br>Jealousy
    I get sort of...everytime I see something done that I was just thinking about
    doing or in the process of, I could say "great but that might have been me". Don&#39;t
    feel this way much anymore.<br><br>Concern, less so...Building something new is
    a bunch of blips and fits and starts. More start than finish and it always changing.
    The market sorts everything out.<br><br>But Mark!...Keep pushing my friend...melancholy
    is not a poise I see often on you.

  content: Node.js would be an interesting way of implementing it. <br><br>As far
    as OpenFF, it has gone through much change, do to members either getting bogged
    down by work, drifting away from the service, or the various changes of what it
    will be implemented in. Not having a clear development team, hasn&#39;t made it
    hard or as important, I adopted the API work, but it&#39;s fallen to the way side,
    sadly.

  content: I want to see OpenFF, Diaspora and any other solution succeed. But ideally,
    I like all of them to work on standards or at least gateways so that they all
    can work together somehow. I have my doubts that this would happen but the Open
    Source Community should support both their respective distribution and other Open
    Source projects as much as possible. In the social networking case, number of
    users is a key factor for effectiveness so it makes each project stronger by integrating
    in some form.

  content: 'Mark, I understand your jealousy completely. When we see individuals or
    groups of people that are given the red carpet treatment when it hasn&#39;t been
    earned, it&#39;s easy to see the innate unfairness of the world. In this case,
    diaspora was simply making their pitch at exactly the right time. The backlash
    against Facebook&#39;s privacy policy is massive right now, and people are looking
    for tangible ways to get back at "The Man". Contributing money to a project that
    voices those people&#39;s own complaints is the most direct way that people can
    express their anger.<br><br>I would anticipate that unless Facebook continues
    to trample over peoples privacy for the next few months, this project will end
    up exactly the same as all of the other "open social" products that you have listed
    here. The herd mentality of the media and even the blogosphere has a very short
    attention span. And so, after even one or two weeks I think we are going to see
    the diaspora team drop off the radar in terms of who cares about what they are
    doing. As you said, they have not actually produced anything except expressing
    ideals that run contrary to what Facebook is doing.<br><br>Thus, we can learn
    a lesson from this. Positoning and timing *can be* extremely important when dealing
    with a small company like a startup. If you launch as soon as a void that needs
    filling opens up, you can become rich and famous. A direct real-life parallel
    to this truth can be found by examining the events immediately following the breakup
    of the soviet union. Those Russians who had connections and a moderate amount
    of power AT THAT TIME were able to grab everything from the rapidly dissolving
    state around them.<br><br>At any other time, those people would never have been
    able to increase their wealth and power so quickly. Accordingly, startups also
    benefit from timing and positioning.<br><br>The only sure way to avoid a reliance
    on timing and luck in a new product is simply to work your ass off and create
    something that has genuine value and utility in some aspect of our lives. Most
    mid-level companies that make a few million $ a year come from this seed. Most
    of the massive companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook (almost) have also
    sprung from this seed, but they have also benefited from lucky timing and positioning.
    <br><br>Luck is just a fact of life, and it really is the difference between a
    runaway success, and just a good success. The sooner we accept this fact, the
    sooner we can become more at peace with ourselves and disperse the illusion of
    instant riches and fame being possible for every startup.<br><br>Thanks for your
    article Mark. : )'

  content: Mark, keep going no matter what. If what you makes brings value to our
    lives, it will be successful (to what degree, I don&#39;t know ^_^). These groups
    of people that happen to cash in on current sentiments of people are just small
    flashes in a sea of talent and entrepreneurship. Just think of diaspora as being
    a bunch of kids who won the lottery. :)

  content: Node.js is awesome. I think the existence of all of these alternative social
    projects that have progressed so far, but have not reached any meaningful audience
    highlights the extreme importance of PR, marketing, and SELLING a project.

<p>Four young coders are tapping into public resentment of centralized social web services with <a HREF="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/196017994/diaspora-the-personally-controlled-do-it-all-distr">Diaspora</a>, a distributed social tool they plan to hack out this summer. </p>
<p>My reaction is mixed. </p>
<p>Part jealousy. At the speed and social proof these guys have achieved by saying they're going to build a tool. I haven't been able to successfully pitch prototypes of similar tools and concepts to investors who would own a large share of the resultant business. With over 83k raised in just a couple of weeks with absolutely no investor strings attached, the Diaspora team has tapped into the public far more effectively than I had imagined possible. I found out early this morning in a well thought post from my friend <a href="http://ontekusuto.iamronen.com/2010/05/freedom/">Ronen</a> that my favorite blogger <a href="http://mobile.twitter.com/fredwilson/status/13882434038">has broadcast</a> his financial support for the project (disclosure he has invested in Kickstarter).</p>
<p>Part respect. They're doing everything right. They're crowd sourcing funding for a distributed social web tool which they'll open the source for as the summer goes on. I understand and respect what they're striving to establish: Removal of the social middleman and attention tax for large scale social web communication.</p>
<p>Part concern. This isn't the first time a new group decided to replicate the functionality of a centralized social network using open social protocols and standards. I actively followed open friendfeed after Facebook acquired the friendfeed company, and it has yet to gain any real traction almost a year later. Identi.ca leverages Status.net software to achieve an open form of Twitter but their social network has had a very slow growth that hasn't achieved wide spread adoption. There are other open social implementations that good friends have developed:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://openmicroblogger.org/">OpenMicroBlogger</a> is a suite of tools developed by all star hacker Brian Hendrickson.</li>
<li> RedRob.in is my cofounder Tyler's Rails implementation of Status.net compliant social software, leveraging source he derived from OpenGard.in. "It's a fully ostatus compliant micro blogging platform I built in rails"</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall I wish the young team great success, and hope they can leverage some of the tools and communication protocols that other folks have developed over the past few years.      </p>
<p>In the comments I mentioned node.js without carefully reviewing the server code. I got a better understanding after reading the documentation and watching this presentation by Ryan Dahl<br />
