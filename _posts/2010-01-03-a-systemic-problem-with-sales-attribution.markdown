  have spent some cycles digging into what I see now as a great opportunity for market
  disruption. Advertising as we know it is about to go through a pretty heavy shift.

  content: I can&#39;t see the end, but I can recognize the beginning of a big shift.
    Once any reasonable opportunity becomes available the market will flock to it.
    Hope I&#39;m part of the solution :D

  content: Mark,<br><br>I&#39;m not sure this requires such a technically complex
    solution. Let me show you how I handle this with my subscription-based site <a
    href="http://shortscreen.com/" rel="nofollow">Short Screen</a>. Once you become
    a premium member, you have the option of becoming an affiliate by clicking <a
    href="http://shortscreen.com/become-an-affiliate" rel="nofollow">here</a>. You
    then get a unique bit of code to cut and paste on your blog. <br><br>That code
    appears as a clickable affiliate badge in the shape of the site&#39;s logo. If
    your readers click on it, they get taken to a sign up page where they are automatically
    offered a 5% discount on the site&#39;s regular membership fee. If they join,
    the site knows they clicked over from your blog, so it credits your affiliate
    account with the commissions. You can log onto your account and track your earnings
    in real time (the actual money gets sent to you by check on a monthly basis, once
    you accrue $100 in referral commissions). <br><br>Now, what happens if your readers
    click over to my site through your affiliate badge but don&#39;t join right away?
    What if they go directly to my site the next day? They&#39;ll see that it costs
    more to join than it did when they clicked through the affiliate badge on your
    blog. So they&#39;ll probably go back to your blog and click through your badge
    to join. It&#39;s possible they could go through another blog&#39;s affiliate
    badge, but it&#39;s also possible that could work to your advantage in other cases,
    i.e., say Arnold is an affiliate as well, and a mutual reader of yours first reads
    about the site there, and then clicks through your affiliate badge after reading
    about it a second time. <br><br>The salient point is that my site isn&#39;t competing
    with its distribution channel, because it is charging a slightly higher price
    for those who join directly than it is for those who join through affiliates.

    the main site. And I agree that I&#39;m probably asking too much with: "simple
    statistical models that correlate user purchase actions with multiple relevant
    product referrals can fairly distribute affiliate revenue". Maybe one day we&#39;ll
    have the Net integration/information availability necessary to make this plausible,
    but we&#39;re not there yet.'

<p>I see tracking as a HUGE part of the solution to this problem:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It's great seeing an important systemic error getting attention. Let's invent some brilliant tracking solutions to renew the affiliate concept and maybe make a few bucks along the way.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What we need are smarter links. First off users should see something like a shortened URL. We can do all sorts of fancy link tracking with shortened urls. We need a way of identifying user action with high confidence that was at least partially the result of earlier content sharing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When three of my super human filters or friends all praise a service or product who should get the affiliate cut? Right now only the last one does, unless I choose to go directly to the source or puchase from another friends affiliate link.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">On average the link value has the greatest value when it leads me to relevant and quality information, maybe even free of charge. How about a regular donation (user decided each month) that let's us show appreciation for quality links and sharing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It's clear that affiliate link value is under rewarded, driving us to search and invent more motivating models. Victus Media's personal ads are initially designed around affiliate revenue (via Amazon), but we're more than happy to consider more effective alternatives.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Users could even tip us with a mini-payment if they appreciated a quality shared link, or go as far as signing up for a monthly or various per click fees to advertise their links through are matching system.</p>
