    of western culture). I think it&#39;s better! to look for them inside:<br>Freedom:

  content: You realize that there are people who would disagree with you about children
    and raising them?  Since you are concerned with other&#39;s children as much as
    your potential progeny, it behooves you to think about the idea of offering choice
    and why it is a good idea or not.<br><br>I&#39;ll write you an email about it
    later, after you get back.

  content: Mark, about what you said with small choices now making huge impacts later...
    it&#39;s so absolutely true. Can you imagine 1000 years ago, looking at the life
    of a beggar. He decides one night to "get together" with a prostitute. 500 years
    later, one of his descendants becomes the king of England.<br><br>Even though
    his life was insubstantial, the decisions he made still echoed out into the pages
    of history. :)

  content: I think about it often. But without an incredibly accurate predictive  <br>engine,
    I rely on my best guesses and realize my "future spotting" is  <br>just a fun
    hobby.

  content: Last night I went out for a beer with a guy formerly known as the Chassidic
    Rebel.  Something you realize when you go out with a beer occasionally with someone
    like that- there are people and places and cultures in this world where the idea
    of success is very narrow- choices are very defined and very certain, rather than
    being open.<br><br>7 years ago I couldn&#39;t have that beer (ignoring my age).  Not
    something done, the path was defined at the time.

<p>While enjoying a breakfast suited for kings, I pondered the paths our lives take based on location and social networks of opportunity. The decisions our parents make form the foundation for our early development. Likewise our life decisions provide paths for our children. As young folks progress into adulthood we impart a sensation of freedom to them. They learn that their decisions and determination can greatly influence their future. The greater the variety of choices we can offer young folks, the better. </p>
<p>Part of me wants to create unlimited opportunities for any generations that follow me*. A balancing concern is a desire to not spoil my kids. It's vital that they understand the value in working towards goals, and the satisfaction of achievement. The most important thing we can pass on to our young is a healthy respect for the freedom of choices. Although we live in a free society, financial wealth provides liberties far beyond those guaranteed by law.  </p>
<p>A large portion of our time is spent in building "better" lives for ourselves, our families, and our friends. It's silly yet sobering to consider how small decisions now can have broad ramifications on the lives of those who come after us. Tiny changes now eminate outward to the future, like never ending waves on the ocean. Some grow in size over time and are reinforced by the decisions and dedication of others.</p>
<p>Notes<br />
*= not just my own kids if/when I have any    </p>
