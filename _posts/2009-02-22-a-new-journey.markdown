  content: Thanks for the feedback. Felt like it was time for a change, and the final

<p>Each new path in life is marked by a decision.&#0160; The choice inspires an entirely new future, and provides a fertile soil from which unimaginable networks of new possibilities arise.&#0160; My deepest wish is that by sharing my humble perspectives, you, the reader, will gain a quantum of motivational energy sufficient to spark a powerful and positive decision and corresponding path for your own life.</p>
