<p>I put together a simple video and feed tracker from a number of independent sources in my spare time over the past couple of days. The sources include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Alert feeds</li>
<li>YouTube Video Search</li>
<li>Stack Overflow Questions tagged CoffeeScript</li>
<li>and even my CoffeeScript blog posts</li>
</ul>

<p>When it's complete the code will perform a number of simultaneous up to date searches for CoffeeScript content.</p>
