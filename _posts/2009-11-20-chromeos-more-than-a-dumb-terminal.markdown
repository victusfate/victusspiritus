<h2>But Mark what's a terminal?</h2>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with older computer architectures here's the low down on terminals. Back in the olden days, when the Internet was a gleam in engineers eye's (and even further), most business and educational computer system architectures consisted of one or more mainframes/super servers, and many terminal nodes. Terminals had limited memory and functionality but were capable of directing resources on a heavy hitting server. Terminals were cheap and would allow many users to access central processing systems. Meanwhile home computers (the desktop) were just coming into existence (commodore/ vic20, TI99). In parallel both servers and desktop systems evolved. Eventually, in most businesses the desktop prevailed as a more useful node than the dumb terminal. </p>
<p>The web has captured many of our imaginations. And Google percieves (among others) a user need for dedicated portals to web services. In effect Chrome OS will allow for advanced terminals to one super mainframe of information, the Internet.</p>
<h2>Pros and Cons of Chrome OS</h2>
<p>The advantages include simplicity in administration, security, and portability for any browser OS system. The disadvantages include a lack of localized resources (minimal local caching), and reliance on connectivity for almost all functionality.</p>
<p>We use a variety of systems: a desktop, laptop or developer capable smartphone. The smartphone merges functionally with larger devices when I can code comfortably on it, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/apple.html">Paul Graham mentioned this need recently</a>. My preference is a full functioning OS with an optimized browser. Then I get the best of both worlds.</p>
<h2>Quick Top Level Description</h2>
<p>If you are new to the Chrome OS, or would like a refresher on the current project vision this video should help you get an idea of the design direction of the Chrome OS.</p>

<p>This is a longer video (just over 11min) that shows a version of Chrome OS in action.<br />
