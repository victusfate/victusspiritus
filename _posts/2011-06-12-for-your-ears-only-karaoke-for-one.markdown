<h2>Booze and bad singers don't mix</h2>
<p>We were out last night celebrating Michelle's sister Stephanie's 25th birthday at Viva Juan 2. For locals the Arroz con Pollo was good, but it's better at Don Quixotes. There were a couple of people that could hold a tune, and their songs were a blessing. But everyone else remorselessly squealed through the lyrics off key and at incredibly tortuous amplified volume.</p>
<p>I loathe crowded, and loud karaoke bars. Yet I enjoy listening to friends sing, and bordering on hypocritical I sing poorly, and often.</p>
<h2>Admitted Singer</h2>
<p>I catch myself singing at the strangest of moments. I sing to my wife before dinner. I sing to my dogs while I'm cleaning up after them. I sing to myself when I'm driving, or when I'm closing in on getting a tricky piece of code to work. Most of the time I sing in odd voices made up for the sake of summoning a smile, either a dear friends or my own. But I still don't get Karaoke. Crowds and my singing voice don't mix. Besides, I'm not sure a margarita filled audience would appreciate the finer points of my howling revival of Tina Turner's "Private Dancer".</p>
