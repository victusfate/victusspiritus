  content: Good post Mark. I think you&#39;re right to pursue your dream. But as I&#39;ve
    always pointed out, it&#39;s very important to keep an eye on your cash flow.
    Cash flow gives you options...

  content: I&#39;m an option junky, so cash flow is always something that floats  <br>around
    in my decision making. My sacrifice to the day job has  <br>empowered me with
    the ability to outsource pieces of design to experts  <br>that I can hack around.
    In addition I can eat, play, have a roof over  <br>mine and Michelle&#39;s head!
    My minimum burn rate is 3k a month but 4k is  <br>much more pleasant.

  content: Mark, when i read about "Local optima" I had a chord struck inside of my
    heart. It is absolutely true that leaving the local optima is very difficult in
    both our day-to-day actions and overarching career path.<br><br>I have been reading
    a book recently called "The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen
    R. Covey in which the author describes our tendency to focus on the urgent, but
    not necessarily most important, tasks placed before us. Now, having read your
    post, I would postulate that this tendency for us to focus on the immediate at
    the expense of the long term also creeps into our overall career building.<br><br>^_^

  content: Always inspiring to hear someone&#39;s personal story of  reinvention.  In
    this age of disruption in technology circles, it seems that the concept of "career"
    is experiencing that same dynamic.  I have a passion for entrepreneurism and love
    to hear stories of people taking that plunge.  Thank you for sharing yours.  I
    just sent it over to Twitter!  Enjoy you over at AVC and looking for your disqus
    profile (to mine those resources you mentioned) found your blog instead.  Good
    luck with all this!  See you back over at Fred&#39;s pub.

<p><a href="http://www.stuckincustoms.com/2009/01/01/the-road-to-tomorrow-happy-2009/ "><img class="alignnone size-full" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2010/04/l_500_332_1CD4D345-2BB4-4260-A0E3-E3A10C0231E5.jpeg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>At the end of 2008, after nearly 13 years my career hit a wall. Actually it happened long before then (~2001), but I wasn't aware of the problem. My heart was never in it, and without passion for my work I grew to loathe going in each day. I pretended to be an engineer for over a decade and finally took a leave of absence to get my bearings. Don't get me wrong, there were fantastic and fun challenges in my job, and I was pretty good at it, but there was always something missing. As much as I wanted my work life to change drastically, there was no clear path forward, and for a time I was lost.</p>
<h2>Welcome to the Real</h2>
<p>Fast forward 17 months to the present. I'm working 30 hours per week at my old job but it's a different and more pleasant role. My perception has changed dramatically about my day job. It fuels my true passion: pulling together a startup, blogging, and integrating the social web into both. It's a bit of a psychological hack, but I view my time as a company resource of which X hours per week goes to keeping the lights on. I'm making the move from a <a href="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2009/11/04/leaving-a-local-optima-takes-every-ounce-of-our-resolve/">local career &amp; financial optimal</a> to a life where my decisions have a much greater impact on my happiness and success. The challenge of <a href="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2010/01/12/the-wheel-of-need-the-landscape-of-potential-technology/">matching technology to the surface of need</a> and growing it into a business is enormous and addictively fun. Connecting with other people that are doing the same is also deeply satisfying.</p>
<h2>Big Life Changes by Small Iterations</h2>
<p>Besides taking a leave of absence in 2008 which was a big and necessary gear shift, all the changes that lead to my current life path were small adaptions and habit formations. Without a work compass I spent a number of weeks reviewing franchises and other small business opportunites because I knew I wanted to have greater control and responsibility about any work I chose to do. I was ready to mortgage my home and dip into my 401k to buy an existing business, but there was a serious mismatch between buying a business and building a business. All the creative problem solving is refined out of franchises, so that execution and "ownership" is more like a management position (and it pays like one too).</p>
<p>I began blogging in February 2009 after writing <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmasters/messel">40 squidoo lenses</a>, many far from monetizable in topic. Here's my first lens, <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/money-love-1">the profit prophet</a>. It wasn't long before I realized the value of pooling together my web ramblings under my own URL, this blog.</p>
<p>It should have clicked much earlier but after several months enjoying <a href="http://www.avc.com">Fred Wilson's tech/venture business riffs</a>, I realized that a startup wasn't beyond my reach. It took 4 months of struggling with php* and looking around before I bumped into <a href="http://Twitter.com/tylergillies">Tyler Gillies</a>^ on Google wave. With a potent web tech ally, Victus Media was forged. Now we're chasing the pattern that best represents one's digital ghost.</p>
<p>Notes:<br />
*= I never did any web programming before late last year. Now at least I'm pretty familiar with a bunch, but there's always more to learn.</p>
<p>^=Tyler's got a hundred URL identities online, none of which capture his identity well so he's a perfect tester for Victus Media's people browser/reader</p>
