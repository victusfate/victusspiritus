  content: 'By the time you remove time for: day jobs you may not love, pre-self awareness/decision
    making age, school/after school chores, studying, doctor and dental visits, vigorous
    exercise, personal hygiene, boring meetings, and senile/foggy brained years you''re
    left with only a few million minutes. I think it''s time you got cracking on that
    conscious transfer to a robot body to buy some more time.'
