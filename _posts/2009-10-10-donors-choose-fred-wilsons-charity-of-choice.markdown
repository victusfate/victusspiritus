<p><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/10/donors-choose-blogger-challenge-somethings-wrong.html">Fred Wilson</a> supports an organization called <a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?page=1&amp;max=10&amp;id=24196&amp;category=110">DonorsChoose.org</a>. The nonprofit is groovy because it lets you pick your favorite projects for classrooms and directly support it. I encourage everyone that can give (even something small) to help pitch in. Each of the projects listed empowers those who inherit our imagination. Let's help the folks that can directly inspire students to greatness. We can make a huge difference by supporting teachers who are actively imagining and implementing novel teaching methods.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the bloggers that rally to support our students and their educators.</p>
