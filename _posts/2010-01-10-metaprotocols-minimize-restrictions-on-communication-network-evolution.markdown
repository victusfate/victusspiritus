<h2>Dumb Pipes Enable Optimization &amp; Resilience for an Unpredictable Future</h2>
<p>Last night I sent out an off the cuff ideal:</p>
<blockquote><p>My one wish, to be capable of providing dumb unlimited pipes to everyone, and everything. Free the net, free the future.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Working Definition:</strong> Dumb pipes are communication channels which don't restrict the type of information which flows through them. Any form of restricted network can be implemented over dumb pipes.</p>
<h2>Metaprotocols are Dynamic Protocols</h2>
<p>The protocol the network is founded on is a restriction on the open nature of dumb pipes. In order to overcome this limitation, a network architecture may be mutable. This is achievable in a network woven together by dumb pipes. The caveat being both transmitter and receiver must be able to agree on a message description language, and handshake method. This form of self describing message is what I refer to as a metaprotocol. It's similar to metaprogramming, but instead of a self modifying language, a metaprotocol is an adaptive communication channel.</p>
<p>This would alleviate the necessity of predefined protocols, at the cost of protocol transfer/translation time. Some great protocols which provide wide flexibility are TCP/IP, HTTP, RSS, &amp; the open Twitter API? A metaprotocol could emulate any of these formats by transmitting a protocol description in the header with a type and release ID. Local caching would eliminate the need to continually transmit/translate a protocol. Alternative (or additional) implementations could query a server for an unknown protocol from a provider (kinda like DNS for URL translation).</p>
<p><strong>It's imperative we collectively understand why the nature of the Net, and our future as a connected global species depends on dumb pipes: maximum future flexibility.</strong></p>
<p>I'll wrap up by calling attention to some of the primary features of dumb pipes. Network fans/pros are more than welcome to contribute to this list, leave a comment. As an eternal sophmore I make sure to minimize how much I "know" at any given moment ;).</p>
<ul>
<li>Channel Noise</li>
<li>bandwidth</li>
<li>latency</li>
</ul>
<p>These basic features drive other descriptive channel parameters like:</p>
<ul>
<li>throughput: amount of information that can be transmitted and received is a combination of bandwidth &amp; channel noise</li>
<li>response delay: back and forth throughput + latency to respond</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: I didn't mention message failure rate because it's captured by the channel noise parameter. For HTTP, message failure can cause a delay of a few seconds when an initial request fails to make a connection</em></p>
