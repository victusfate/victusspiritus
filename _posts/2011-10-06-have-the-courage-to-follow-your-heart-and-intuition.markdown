  content: "I have seen this video repeatedly over a number of years and when I tuned
    in again today, tuned into the lens of intuition, I saw something that I had totally
    missed.  As Steve Jobs described that at the moment of crisis when the Apple board
    let him go, who did he turn to?\n\nHaving also read \"Think and Grow Rich\" by
    Napoleon Hill a few times, it hit me that Jobs in his commencement speech talked
    about his \"mastermind\" group.  For all the times I have listened to this, only
    today did the names David Packard and Bob Noyce spring out.\n\nWhat a mastermind
    group Jobs had even at his worst professional moment.  I went back to my bookcase
    and pulled out yet again \"Think and Grow Rich\".  The aspect of intuition it
    discusses is its THIRTEENTH PRINCIPLE.  The book says this about \"Sixth Sense\"
    :\n\n<b>\"This principle is the apex of the philosophy.  It can be assimilated,
    understood, and applied only by first mastering the other twelve principles\"</b>\n\nSo
    according to Napoleon Hill, intuition or sixth sense fits in a larger context
    of development, and those principles are laid out in the manner that he learned
    from Carnegie.\n\nWhile I too possess a strong intuitive nature, I can also profess
    on skipping and taking shortcuts, so much so that I trust in the pursuit of tiny
    differences showing me the way.  I do believe that something will emerge, but
    I do that at the expense of not earning the right to be able to understand fully
    the emergence as it occurs.  \n\nThings are emerging all the time, and while I
    treat the passing of Steve Jobs as a seminal moment, because the video above and
    the book I have mentioned have been a part of many re-visitations.  I can credit
    my intuition being a guide to having a lived a fortunate life, but on its own,
    what intuition keeps telling me is that I am not prepared, rather than not ready
    - for my own life journey.\n\nThat preparation is sweat equity, which when I honestly
    appreciate it in context of the 12 principles that are laid out before he even
    mentions \"Six Sense\" - has not rightly been earned.  What I have learned can
    serve my intuition, but earning I feel is a right well before it becomes a reward. 
    \n\nSome people are born with a silver spoon in their mouth, and earning has been
    that which has been inherited, but that isn't earning my freedom.  As imaginative
    as I can be, the earning is apparent when I look at my life path dots backwards. 
    Then I see how expedience has robbed moments, which Steve Jobs in his life, faced
    with full head on force.\n\nNo one wants their faith tested, the majority seek
    the path of least resistance.  In that regard I maybe selling myself short because
    I have lived an unusual path, but I have not put it all out there also, I know
    how much of my life has been lived on borrowed gas - but faith needs me to burn
    my own fuel.\n\nThat is where I can draw instant inspiration from Steve Jobs life,
    he left nothing to spare, even kept moving forward when he was running on empty. 
    My intuition must not then become a looking glass at the things I could have done,
    but an intent that is vivid in Steve Jobs commencement words. \n\nSo long as I
    appreciate my underutilized capability, and trust it fully, then I can have faith
    that stalling isn't a future path, calling is.  So long as I accept this seminal
    moment with full authentic spirit, the future calls, even if I still don't know
    what that calling is.\n\nI think now is a good time for me to revisit yet again,
    Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill.\n\n<b>[Em]</b>\n\n\n\n"

    I think it's a good time for me to join you in that reading. 

    The mentor team Steve turned to was part of a unique bench of super entrepreneurs, one can only comprehend perhaps as a silicon valley icon. 

    "That is where I can draw instant inspiration from Steve Jobs life, he left nothing to spare, even kept moving forward when he was running on empty."

    From this attribute I draw inspiration. How can one have such intent as to not allow their very existence to hampen their life's work? He explains in the video, because he still loved what he did. To love one's labor deeply makes it inseparable from the individual. Steve's work was very much a part of who he was.

  content: "The ultimate gospel is a life lived rich in meaning, value and purpose. 
    There is no gospel that gets one to that richness, but there is in the act of
    becoming a guide.  The gospel of Richard Dawkins is a guide, the gospel of Napoleon
    Hill is a guide, the gospel of Jesus Christ is a guide, the gospel of Nietzsche
    is a guide.  The hard part is determining how we guide ourselves and the way we
    utilize the guide and whether the chosen compass serves the most relevant way
    - that leads to richness.\n\nIn that regard \"Think and Grow Rich\" is a guide
    that has great merit, so long as one is ready for it.  I watched a Kurt Warner
    documentary and why Green Bay let him go, the response of then quarter back coach
    Steve Mariucci was simple.  \"Kurt wasn't ready\".  \n\nA lot of what makes a
    football player like Kurt Warner or Walter Peyton special in our eyes is their
    ability to accept guidance, their love of guiding others to excellence and ultimately
    guiding their teams when key aspects come together.  \n\nWhat comes together maybe
    in the laps of providence, but the provision that arises depends in being ready,
    being true and being ever aware.  The one thing that jumps off the page in reading
    \"Think and Grow Rich\" for me, is the price-value relationship.  That one has
    to pay a price to create value.\n\nAt the same time, there is thing called the
    \"third generation curse\" i.e. when we are the ones whose efforts were pioneering
    and we are the ones who built the value, then succeeding generations are affected
    by the value we have ultimately created.  One of the chief reasons that Warren
    Buffett gave away billions, instead of passing it all on to succeeding generations,
    because Buffett realizes the true richness of being a value creator.\n\n<b>Beating
    the Third Generation Curse</b>\nhttp://www.forbes.com/global/1998/1130/0118064a.html\n\nSo
    I have come to look at this in an integral way, in as much totality my awareness
    can lead me to - and that awareness extends to the old adage \"be careful what
    you wish for\".  In this larger context, I can use my intuition to see the bigger
    picture, and then begin the journey of drilling down, to chisel away and breakdown
    or breakthrough to my calling.  That is where I am at this present juncture of
    time - feeling that calling is sitting under a gigantic mess of too much thinking,
    and not enough separating the wheat from the chaff.\n\nThe rhetorical question
    \"do I have what it takes\" is a really stupid question IMHO - since we can only
    find guidance as to what blocks us from the flow of adding richness to existence.  
    What we don't think about is how impoverished we really are, whenever we merely
    are influenced by glory or to be but emulations of greatness.  We are all born
    great, but then we let that greatness slip, fall away or get chewed up by life's
    circumstances.  I have to redefine what poverty really is before I understand
    what life looks like when it is truly rich.  \n\nWith that perspective, poverty
    no longer becomes a financial thing - but a higher value of human spirit.  Even
    though I was born into a poor neighbourhood, I was also born rich.  Go to any
    village that lacks basic amenities and you will still find great people.  They
    have not lost their greatness, it is we who define what is great by falling into
    the trap of comparison - rather than gravitating with grace towards the richness
    of living a richer existence.  \n\nThat is the ever so personal context in which
    I am attribute and am reading this book and if abundance becomes a part of that
    journey, then so be it - I have to deal with whatever life throws at me, when
    it is thrown and however life manifests itself - and here the book does great
    service - because it redefines sacrifice, failure and set backs, into a richer
    scheme of things.  \n\nI already have a broad perspective, my goal is to find
    the landing strip of my calling, and when I recognize that calling, remain grounded
    and set a foundation to a richer existence - rich equating with meaning, value
    and purpose, rather than a monetary value.  So here, I raise a toast to our individual
    life journeys and how our respective efforts and unique life ways enable that
    richness.\n\nM."

<p>I'm sitting in bed at 4am typing with my thumbs on a tiny Apple computer, and thinking about the passing of the legendary entrepreneur Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>We were given one last lesson from Steve, which he shared years ago in a commencement speech:</p>
<p>"Your time is limited so don't waste it living someone else's life. Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition" Steve Jobs</p>
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc&sns=em</p>
<p>Our mortality is a blessing and a curse. A curse because we continually lose the ones dearest to us, and a blessing because it concentrates our courage and will to live.</p>
<h2>Introspection</h2>
<p>While out walking yesterday on a delightfully crisp autumn morning, a recurring question echoed with each step. What is my most potent ability, what affinity do I possess which deserves a greater portion of my time and energy, and how can I cultivate this strength to bring prosperity to my family and loved ones? </p>
<p>One answer I came upon early this morning was unexpected. It isn't my computer acumen, which I've spent years experimenting with and honing. It wasn't my scientific background in school, or my applied engineering expertise acquired on the job. It isn't my boundless curiosity for learning, a quality which I'm blessed to have and which birthed this blog. The one irreplaceable attribute I possess is a unique gift to all individuals, yet it is a personal quality mired in superstition. It is simply named intuition.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>intuition</strong></p>
<p>1 he works according to intuition: instinct, intuitiveness; sixth sense, clairvoyance, second sight.</p>
<p>2 this confirms an intuition I had: hunch, feeling (in one's bones), inkling, (sneaking) suspicion, idea, sense, notion; premonition, presentiment; informal gut feeling, gut instinct.<br />
(from <a href="http://studios.handmark.com/oxmutils/entry_def.php?dict=OAWT&edition=2&lexid=t_en_us1007615&dn=osx-iPhone">Oxford Mobile</a>)
</p></blockquote>
<p>Intuition is the attribute which has the highest potential for earning my freedom, if only I can hone it and trust it with my well being. Intuition is a guide that is the synthesis of reason and emotion, and serves as a foundation for all decision making. Unravelling intuition may well be the most productive path of my generation.</p>
