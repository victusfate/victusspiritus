  systems all day. We carry our smart phone/portables with us at all times. At work
  or at home we have access to the greatest and fastest growing public network of
  information ever created (the Internet). We use a wide variety of devices for transportation,
  manufacturing, construction, repair and destruction. But our tools have been refined
  (evolved) to respond and react in an expected manner. Only when accidents occur
  are we surprised by our machines. And those mishaps are often related to human error.\r\n\r\nWhile
  people's bodies may be complex biomechanical machines, our minds identify us. As
  emotional beings we are continually seeking activities that arouse our interest.
  From day one in my writing here, I have set out to better understand the powerful
  force of inspiration, and to share my discoveries. I believe our most meaningful
  efforts are realized by aligning our work with our passion. Experiencing <a href=\"http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2009/08/31/ebb-and-flow-ode-to-zen-habits/\">the
  rhythms of our productivity</a>, we will have bad days, good days, and phenomenal
  breakthrough moments."

<h1>Learn, Decide, Execute, Repeat</h1>
<p>In a personal quest to uncover and create value, I've made the same error in planning my activities. Each week I have attempted to create a cyclic effort, mimicking an automaton. My mantra: <strong>Learn, Decide, Execute, Repeat</strong>. But creating or revealing tremendous value for society is more than systematic work. There is an inherent artistic aspect of entrepreneurship and invention. The novel application of our existing resources is the heart of value creation. Each of our genuine creative muses may lead us down unique paths. We would be wise to listen to our own more often.</p>
<p>Yes, we need to learn. What do potential users or customers truly value about our offering?</p>
<p>Yes, we have to decide. Which is the best way to move forward with our current community or businesses goals?</p>
<p>Yes, we have to execute. Iterative implementation transforms abstract designs to concrete products and services. In the process of executing, we often learn much more than in our initial surveys.</p>
<p>And we almost certainly have to repeat this process many times.</p>
<p>There is an ongoing competition between more or less structured design methodologies. There are some that embrace <a href="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2009/10/24/startups-the-agents-of-evolutionary-engineering/">evolutionary engineering</a>, and those that follow a more disciplined design route.</p>
