  content: Mark, if you look at the big picture, wars produce more money for america
    then if those dollars and lives went directly into the economy in the form of
    new business. It&#39;s sad, but america has a massive military-industrial complex
    that requires wars to feed on.

  content: I just can&#39;t see any value created from so many lives spent on destruction.
    How does that generate wealth for the people Leland?

  content: I should clarify, it doesn&#39;t generate value for the american people
    on the whole, but it does generate a LOT of value for the military industrial
    complex, whom control much more of the democratic process then many people realize.
    :)<br><br>Additionally, most of the homeland security industry (all of which is
    privately owned) depend on how scared the american people are. If there are no
    wars, what is there to be scared of? America always needs something evil and dangerous
    to tell it&#39;s people to be scared of. Today it is terrorists and such, tomorrow
    it might be China or north korea.<br><br>The fashion industry does things the
    same way. Every season there is a new style... the old styles are tossed aside
    to make room for the new styles, which only have more value in the minds of people
    who care about fashion. The homeland security industry is like the fashion industry,
    they need to continuously invent new things to be protected from.

  content: "Wars might produce money, but they don't produce wealth or value. Just
    inflation and forced redistribution. While the US military has come up with some
    tech innovation, the price tag is enormous in both life and the dollar's/US long-term
    economic health for any products spun off military research. \n\nThe public sector
    can't keep growing forever in both employees and relative pay. By far the greatest
    threat to US democracy and freedom is in eventual economic collapse.      "

  content: "The course correction will require shrinking government spending. I don't
    see a successful party focused on lean gov. \n\nLibertarians could represent this
    group, but there's not enough folks in this group nationally to push through reform.
    Maybe swayed reps and dems? "

<p><em>As we waited within aroma range of the barbecue at Michelle's parents' house yesterday, I broached the subject of finance. I kicked off the conversation with a comment/question about my pop's surprisingly good retirement fund performance. Although my dad wasn't there, one retiree and two gents closing in on retirement were more than ready to contribute their understanding. This post relays a few of the ideas stirred up by grill side in our collective attempt to predict what will drive the US economy of the future.</em></p>
<h2>Counter Intuitive Fund Returns</h2>
<p>My dad was fortunate (and smart) in his investments this past year with solid growth (8-10%) despite the overwhelming national unemployment (9.5%) and underemployment levels (18%). This didn't add up to me, as I continue to see large industries shrinking, even my normally rock solid day job (R&amp;D engineering). How could investments be rising in direct conflict to so many shrinking industries?</p>
<p>What we're observing is businesses becoming leaner, and this contraction is long term due to a lack of predicted future demand. Independent of other economic signals, our national economy is still in the midst of compression (realignment?), with some notable exceptions. Apple has had stellar performance and other tech giants Google and Microsoft are highly profitable, although their publicly traded stocks reflect slower growth (check the NASDAQ).</p>
<p>We're living through large scale reallocation of labor. Private (pre-public) companies like Facebook, Twitter and Zynga are growing exceptionally fast. They're becoming increasingly efficient at extracting value from information exchange and <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2010/07/30/efficient-markets-tools-which-extract-value-from-aggregate-leisure/">aggregate social interaction</a>. Besides theses popular late stage startups which are transitioning to larger corporations, there are a myriad of smaller successes that are ultra efficient. The most successful tiny company I can think of is <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites">Craigslist</a>, likely because it's <a href="http://garagedollar.com">GarageDollar's</a> chief competitor.</p>
<h2>The New Economy Requires New Skills</h2>
<p>I'm not alone in my frantic race to ramp up skills to a professional level in new areas (web apps). Nor am I the only guy with entrepreneurial instincts that have been ignited by increased opportunity in a shifting economy. The majority of underemployed Americans are finding new jobs at small businesses or building new opportunities for themselves.</p>
<p>Following investment dollars, we are witnessing a rise of (super) angel investors. These investors plan to profit with smaller companies and exits ($20-50 million) than what is normally required for historic venture capital deals (100 million+). How many Facebook's or Google's arise each year? The answer, not many.  And the numbers won't drastically increase as thriving businesses are modular and hyper focused. It's no surprise to me that startups arise out of obscurity with a single focused product offering. Only when businesses hedge their bets by moving into multiple markets does growth flatten off (market saturation the cause).</p>
<h2>Beyond bombs and bullets, Profitable US exports</h2>
<p><em>Let's jump past my frustrated political thoughts on the heavy social and financial costs of war^ to profitable exports.</em> Now that we've covered a cursory overview of internal shifts in the US economy, it leads us naturally to national exports. Just what exactly are we selling to the rest of the world? There is little doubt that the future network economy will be global.</p>
<p>US major exports today(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States">source</a>):</p>
<table cellspacing="5">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th><strong>Export goods</strong></th>
<td>agricultural products (soybeans, fruit, corn) 9.2%, industrial supplies (organic chemicals) 26.8%, capital goods (transistors, aircraft, motor vehicle parts, computers, telecommunications equipment) 49.0%, consumer goods (automobiles, medicines) 15.0% (2009)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Today chief exports can be broken down into a handful of broad categories.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Capital Goods - precision assembled goods, Hi-Tech, and automobiles</h3>
<p>I lumped capital and consumer goods together based on the type of businesses that support these markets. This number one export includes airplanes, autos, telecommunications equipment, computers and other integrated products. Software and reduced processor sizes has created substantially lighter physical exports reducing costs.</p>
<p>Besides Microsoft Windows and Office a growing number of SaaS and  Internet companies are doing business globally. Google exports and  customizes their search portals to many nations throughout the globe. Facebook, Zynga, and Twitter have presences in dozens of countries. Now our Internet companies can profit from the world's leisure.</p>
<p>Let's not leave off US universities which effectively export education</li>
<li>
<h3>Industrial Supplies</h3>
<p>We'll continue to supply organic chemicals as an export based on our agriculture and pharmaceutical companies. I don't have a strong opinion or knowledge of this market.</li>
<li>
<h3>Agriculture</h3>
<p>Grains, fruits and vegetables are all staple surpluses of the US, composing a large percent of our total exports. With population increases we can expect the agribusiness to continue to grow. You can see how what global demand for various agriculture at <a href="http://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde/latest.pdf">World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates</a>. Also you can see <a href="http://www.fas.usda.gov/grain/circular/2010/07-10/grainfull07-10.pdf">world grain export is heavily from the US</a> at the USDA world markets and trade report.</p>
<p>Smaller organic farms have had success, and this is a trend that could flow back to mega farms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>^= War and Economics: It's hard for me to separate social and fiscal costs from economic review. To put the cost of war into perspective: thousands of lives, many more casualties, and 1 trillion dollars for the past decade. The brave men and women consumed by war are precisely the risky and determine individuals we need to rekindle our economy.</p>
