<h2><strong>Update: Some breaking news that's fantastic</strong></h2>
<p>The <a class="zem_slink" title="Zemanta" rel="homepage" href="http://www.zemanta.com">Zemanta</a> team (ala @<a class="zem_slink" title="AndraÅ¾ Tori" rel="twitter" href="http://twitter.com/andraz">Andraz</a>) has crafted <a href="http://test.infoblow.zemanta.com/infoblow/galaxy/">Galaxy</a>, a relational connector between Zemanta and <a class="zem_slink" title="DBpedia" rel="homepage" href="http://dbpedia.org/About">DBpedia</a> + <a class="zem_slink" title="freebase" rel="homepage" href="http://www.freebase.com/">Freebase</a>. This could save me a jump time from entities to connectors! Just heard about it from <a href="http://twitter.com/andraz/status/6964008502">twitter</a>, here's <a href="http://www.zemanta.com/blog/api-showcase-linked-galaxy/">the full blog post </a>with all the cool details. Unfortunately there's no API for such a connection, so we'll have to do it ourselves anyway. At least I'm aware of the DBpedia and Freebase now.</p>
<h2>Crafting a bot that can read & respond with a personality</h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence has come a long way in my lifetime, certainly specialized processing such as chess programs have surpassed human cognitive ability. Late yesterday, inspired by the work of my colleague Tyler, I proceeded down a path few have tread successfully. The challenge chosen is to craft an interactive social bot.</p>
<p>Here are the modules I'm using and why I believe it's possible:<br />
1) semantic entity extraction allows us to quickly identify a category/type and specific person, place or thing<br />
2) relational semantic lookups give multiple connections between entities in the form of verbs or analogies<br />
3) <a class="zem_slink" title="Corpus linguistics" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_linguistics">corpus linguistics</a> or a search API can weave a series of entities and verbs together<br />
4) simple replacement rules can serve as the style, speech, or accent.<br />
5) the spooky hard part is making all these pieces play together. I have some ideas, but I'm interested to see what others are cooking up.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>In an effort to improve the appeal and utility of the <a href="http://victus-imm.heroku.com">IMM</a>, we're exploring new ways of looking at social search. An interface that one can send and recieve messages from is both desirable and natural.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://hunch.com">Hunch</a> interface, and API could serve as a potential source of answers. Hunch is founded on a basic assumption: if you have the same priorities as other folks, their solutions are likely to be good options for you. If you capture the important factors this architecture works. I appreciate the founder <a href="http://cdixon.org">Chris Dixon's blog</a> and suspect good stuff from this service.</p>
