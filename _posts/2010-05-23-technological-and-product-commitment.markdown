  content: Hi Mark<br><br>The product is the thing....<br><br>A product frame of mind
    is about focus to solve a problem, making a choice and moving forward.<br><br>Everything
    will change but moving forward is the criteria that drives everything else.<br><br>Not  belitling
    the choice of course...

  content: It&#39;s amazing to me that "the thing" can scale where my effort and hours
    cannot. A great many people can leverage a product I nurture into existence while
    I can only spend my time once. It makes all the effort that goes into product
    exploration and design worth while.<br><br>Plus if done right, others can build
    on or with that product and invent new valuable products that were beyond my thoughts.

  content: I don&#39;t think of it that way....<br><br>You scale through what you
    build--a team or company. A method. A brand. Or a product that takes on a life
    of its own. Or a family.<br><br>What we create and add to the world are what makes
    the creative process so unique and so personal.  <br><br>Very few get to actually
    build something greater than themselves.

  content: I enjoyed this short interplay between the two of you.<br><br>The first
    thought it led me to was that there is a (false!) capitalist-based myth-idea that
    freedom (at least the economical kind) can be achieved by "leveraging others".
    I believe this is a false myth and leads to abuse (of the self and of others).
    It is masked with appealing and reasonable philosophies - but if you pursue it
    a bit further you arrive at some highly abusive and dellusional (and popular)
    "business models" - such as multi-level-marketing schemes.<br><br>Then the thought
    moved past objection into something else. There is a movement towards better -
    "You scale through what you build" - the better you build the better you scale.
    When you do this you aturally attract and gravitate towards like-spirited people
    (which is the flipside expression of the capitalist abuse coin). This is dharma.<br><br>Capitalist
    (ie money-value dominated) thinking seems to push us into a pursuit of "more".
    This often (way too often) comes at the expense of pursuing better.

    and building tools which empower users, instead of taxing their attention.

  content: In my view of the social web and social design, you actually build in concert
    with the community that will determine the value and the economics of the product
    or service.<br><br>This is a tangible approach to development and value and business
    model in a world where your community (or customers) defines your brand and your
    value.<br><br>If you can&#39;t attract adopters or community, its a non starter.
    If you can, the process defines itself. <br><br>The big issue of course is the
    first step...which most start-ups don&#39;t achieve...and that is getting something
    functioning that can attract those adopters.<br><br>I&#39;m a believer that Mark
    will do just that!

    the freedom to try new things on that 12th version instead? :)

  content: Unless you get more specific about who you are "users" are (and find a
    better name for them then users!) your assumption that they "want to be empowered"
    has no basis for even debate let alone a product.<br><br>The greatest trap of
    the word "user" amongst development-teams is that unless you make more specific
    choices about it, you will always fall back to your own preferences - and most
    members of development-teams are usually not indicative - and mostly counter-indicative
    to "real users".<br><br>Which is one of the reasons why Facebook has 400 million
    people who don&#39;t even know what you mean by ... ahum ... empowering them!#!@$
    and why you are here talking about empowering!<br><br>If you are consciously aiming
    for people like yourself - then you are creating a development platform for developers
    not an end-user product. In that case you need to ask yourself what those developers
    want and what you want to give them. You also need to realize that since you are
    NOT committing to an end-user product - that you are passing the burden of doing
    that on to your developer-customers... and I have a feeling that will turn them
    off!

  content: 'Passionate and well thought Ronen.<br><br>I want work on tools that help
    me and other folks. You&#39;re right users  <br>is too vague and incorrect: fellow
    value creators may be a better  <br>description but is a little long. If I describe
    the person who would  <br>benefit maybe you can help me come up with a more appropriate
    term?<br><br>The folks I&#39;d like to create tools for should be comfortable
    with web  <br>browsers and interactive GUIs, but don&#39;t need to have a strong
    web  <br>programming or design background. There are too many hoops to go from  <br>that
    point of understanding to sharing and customizing the look of  <br>content from
    a personally moderated source.<br><br>For example: Even modifying Wordpress themes
    is tricky until you  <br>understand where all the divs are for that particular
    one. If I can  <br>see the surface or view of a web page, I should be able to
    manipulate  <br>it easily without spending hours learning details that will likely
    be  <br>depricated in periodic updates (I&#39;ve lost a few tweaks to theme  <br>updating).'

  content: Thanks Arnold, your support means alot!<br><br>So much to take in and synthesize
    while learning the ropes. You nailed it with your description. It&#39;s about
    building something folks can gravitate around and selling a vision. Wild and fun
    exploration :)

  content: 'Hmm Disqus won&#39;t let me directly reply to ronen, so I will post here.
    I don&#39;t completely agree with what Ronen said about just developing for what
    customers want. <br><br>I disagree with him because true innovation always comes
    off a TANGENT from what customers say they want. If you give customers exactly
    what they want, you will end up in an endless slow-iteration process such as what
    Microsoft and the other big companies are stuck in. Endlessly pushing tiny improvements
    and "features" to fix complaints that users have.<br><br>To create something innovative
    and game-changing, developers have to inflect by themselves, keeping in mind current
    and past knowledge from outside sources of course. Through this inflection, new
    and innovative ideas on how processes can be dramatically changed and/or altered
    can be formulated.<br><br>My conclusion: It is important to examine what the end-user
    wants, but directly creating the system based on those wants is not the way towards
    innovation. Self-inflection and idea propagation combined with end-user feedback
    and research is where the sweet spot lies.'

    - The folks need to be not only technically capable but also motivated and in
    line with what you want to achieve.<br> - The folks need to have the time and
    resources to transform your "framework" into good and reliable end-user tools
    (an effort that goes way beyond a, for example, WordPress plugin)<br> - The folks
    need to have the ability to design a good end-user product - this is not a given
    when it comes to programmers.<br> - Assuming they have the time and resources
    - they need to be able to get their products to market.<br> - The folks need to
    feel a balance between their efforts and the fruits of their work.<br><br><br>Most
    importantly - the folks should either be people that exist in the world, or alternately
    - you need to acknowledge what "folks" are actually out there and then see fi
    you can build a bridge into their lives with your "framework". If you don&#39;t
    see the bridge - there&#39;s going to be a deep chasm keeping your "framework"
    from coming to fruition.'

<p>There comes a time in any explorative learning phase where a team has to make a serious commitment to a chosen technology. Every day spent working with web programming exposes me to a few new libraries, frameworks, and languages. I could literally spend the rest of my life learning about web technology without shipping a product, but successful people ship! I will work towards a position where at least a portion of my work schedule is free for learning new tech.   </p>
<p>In the interest of delivering a valuable product before the ferris wheel stops I need to actively refuse learning new translations or implementations, at least for a limited time. Every development team has a half life to build and ship a product. This is true even in the best case scenario where a prototype catches on like wildfire and a full business is built in the wake of a breakthrough. Key lead tech members will move on to other interesting opportunities at some point in the cycle, and the product pattern has to be handed off to other technical curators. For example, it's a lot more exciting for me to help develop the first or second version of a new tool, as opposed to optimizing the 12th generation. But both of these stages of a product are important to customers and critical to businesses.  </p>
<p>If like myself, you find web technology fascinating and constantly shifting, don't forget to force hard deadlines on specific products and technologies. Otherwise in your quest to initiate and connect <a href="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2010/04/12/connect-islands-of-value-then-get-out-of-the-way-2/">new islands of opportunity</a> you may find yourself surrounded by nothing but open sea. A balance must be struck between perceiving potential patterns, and realizing the value of a single product through iteration and execution. </p>
