  content: Actually they weren&#39;t.  Howard Lindzon got friended at one point, I
    had to explain to him what was going on, because he could have exposed the Nasdaq.  One
    of the wierd things of being part of Anonymous Asynchronous Collective Conscious
    is that stuff like that happens.<br><br>It got shut down this morning.  I hope
    I can find out who one facebook will give me a copy of the data so I can visualize
    it in some way shape or form....<br><br>And your critique is within the tradition
    of net Art, See the Critical Art Ensemble, as well as the first virus written
    in Python, biennale.py, by <a href="http://0100101101101.org" rel="nofollow">0100101101101.org</a>.<br><br><a

    - facebook probably has some more the extensive data.  Such as the chats.  I saved
    one. I actually started to cry when it was gone.  The experience itself was amazing.  You
    lose yourself as an artist because you stop being the creator.  You become the
    patron and the artist.  You also realize that there is an idea of consciousness
    of self that you wouldn&#39;t have had.  And that you want to exert control.  It&#39;s
    absolutely terrifying and amazing....<br><br>In a way I&#39;m glad it&#39;s over.  The
    stress level was huge.  I was breaking down last night from the amount of control/lack
    of control.  Last night was the first time I had a real meal in a week.

  content: Personally I find the fact that the first virus written in python is actually
    an art piece and they made t-shirts of it too the day it was released also pretty
    awesome.  Also one of the reasons I want to learn to code.  You do this for a
    while, you do the art, you learn a certain insider veiw of how it works. and then
    you build a business on it.  It&#39;s very hard top explain, because basically
    what you are doing is F***ing around with media.  By the end you should have this
    ultra deep understand of it. <br><br>Some things I&#39;ve seen over my time are
    not pretty, or nice.  But they give you really deep inspiring thoughts.  One of
    the reasons I did what I did was the idea of who is the artists.  A really famous
    manetas peice that has been floating around on the web, and I think may be owned
    by Saatchi (I don&#39;t know) is <a href="http://www.jacksonpollack.org" rel="nofollow">www.jacksonpollack.org</a>.  It
    doesn&#39;t do anything until you start to click around.  And then you make your
    own Jackson Pollack.  Most people took it to be a toy, when really it is a referential
    piece of net art....It even got on the daily candy.<br><br>There the kind of things,
    that if you step back, and think about, ask huge amounts of questions of how to
    build something on the internet.  If you don&#39;t play with it, does it act as
    a harp?  It really needs you, more so than any actual physical object in a museum.  Which
    is sort of scary in terms of art land...<br><br>Then take what I did- I took the
    artist out of the artists.  After I made the profile, I proved the point that
    you don&#39;t even need me to make something.  Think about that.  Think about
    what that means in term of the Internet.<br><br>That&#39;s a mindfuck.  Now build
    a company around the idea of what those ideas are.

  content: I&#39;d argue we did need you to start it off, and certainly needed others
    to contribute/collaborate. So there were still artists involved.<br><br>Not sure
    I see a connection between the mindf#$% and a business just yet, but you&#39;ll
    have plenty of time to show me :D

  content: I finally wrote a real post on the subject.  I feel totally drained.  I
    realized I was treating it/they as human.  I feel slightly like I lost elements
    of a child.  I don&#39;t know what to do now with my regular profile, because
    I have this sudden realization that it isn&#39;t me but it is, and I hate it,
    because it is so unreflective of me, and where I want to go, and what I want to
    do.

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.stuckincustoms.com/2009/10/13/solar-flower-the-giant-robot-of-buenos-aires/"><img class="size-full wp-image-2106 aligncenter" title="Solar Flower of Buenos Aired" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2009/11/SolarFlowofBuenosAires1.jpg" alt="Solar Flower of Buenos Aired" width="480" height="340" /></a></p>
<h1>Giant Mechanical Flower</h1>
<p>I can think of no better example of the blending of artistic and technological evolution than the huge mechanical flower of Buenos Aires, <a href="http://ricardosblog.com/blog/2006/08/floralis_generica_sculpture_in_buenos_aires.html">Floralis Generica</a>. Unfortunately I don't believe there is a functional purpose for the behemoth sculpture, but one could imagine modifications that would allow solar collection with high efficiency. There is a also a flickr group of associated images, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/floralisgenerica/">Floralis Generica</a>. We have discovered new forms of self and group expression, enabled by advanced technology.</p>
<h1>Art Dova</h1>
<p>My friend <a href="http://www.shanacarp.com/essays/my-image-myself">Shana Carp</a> is pushing the boundaries of digital identity and the experience of social media with the project she started <a>Art Dova</a> on Facebook. While there is certainly overstepping of standard Facebook policy, the people involved are all aware a public account is befriending them (according to creator of the profile). By befriending Art Dova you are essentially uncorking the bottle and allowing anyone to see your shared material. Privacy is a big issue with Facebook and other social media corporations, but the essence of the project is one of artistic exploration, as described by Shana. By probing the boundaries of our comfort zone we help to answer the challenging question of virtual identity and how much faith we put in it. The profile is a collaborative creation and has grown beyond the initial input and statuses it was seeded with. Unfortunately it was recently hijacked and turned into a spambot, and then removed. I see the project more as an experiment of policy breaking, but appreciate the shared web experience it offered. Shana describes some of the ideas behind the experiment <a href="http://vukicevic.blogspot.com/2009/11/facebook-generation.html#comment-22053582">here on another friend Vladimir Vukicevic's blog, Beyond the Cave.</a> The following quote captures Shana's sentiment:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's about exploration of an issue. Especially in a post-Duchamp world. So you have to suspend yourself and embrace the controversy. Most people don't realize that most of what we see in classic painting and sculpture were considered riotous. Right now the "art world" is moving very fast and loose because of Duchamp, money, and the 60's revolution, among a few other things. We've been liberated from the idea of the canvas, the idea of purely 2,3, or 4 dimesions. We're allowed to talk about women in art. We're allowed to talk art in context of space. We're allowed to talk about purely color. We're allowed to talk about media.</p></blockquote>
<h1>Other Artistic/Technological Overlaps</h1>
<p>I'd love to hear about your discoveries of style, technology and art all co-evolving. Art beckons for our attention and challenges us, while technology yields new avenues of exploration for the digital evolving self/collective.</p>
