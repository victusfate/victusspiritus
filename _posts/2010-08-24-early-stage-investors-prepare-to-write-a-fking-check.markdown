    Mark, the 'engineer' in me liked your 15-second GarageDollar pitch. Good luck with ignoring the job offers for as long as it takes.

    [warn: unsolicited & obvious stuff follows] Since a bootstrapped entrepreneur's time is extremely valuable, it is better to focus all of your energies on building an awesome, eye popping, super fast GarageDollar and open it up for private-alpha as soon as possible. Convincing/hustling the investors can wait until then (for various reasons you can sit back and think of).

    that I'm getting a hell of a deal.....can you tell me in ONE sentence exactly
    what problem you're solving, and why it's an amazing solution?"

  content: "Couple thoughts:\nClassifieds have always been tied to location and interest.
    From what I understand GD will add real-time to the location/interest and also
    hone in on location, compared to Craigslist (the elephant in this room)\nSome
    marketing angles over CL in this sector could might include the feeling of old-school
    wholesome fun of garage sale adventures adapted into our \nmobile tech world,
    and of course security and trust to foster sharing of location data by those in
    less \nconnected circles (many of whom associate CL=danger from mainstream media
    horror stories) \n\nyou need a lot more marketing focus overall in this type of
    pitch, in my (amateur) opinion- I don't doubt that you can build it, but will
    (and why should) anyone come?\n\n"

    @andyswan
    Even though we don't see a product here, the problem here seems quite easy :
    small sale that needs to go out of stock in 1 or 2 days, needs a location service like GarageSale to broaden its area of customer discovery.
    something like that in my mind anyway...

    Good luck Mark ! and good luck to Tyler too ! You've got the founding team, now give us some eye-candy ! =)

    Absolutely agree.<br>My goal with today's post is to begin refining the pitch and compiling the list of interested and ready investors. There are many sharp folks with funds to invest, but how many are interested in the market we're going after first with G$. Garage dollar is one example with an under served market.

    I've gotten some priceless feedback, appreciate your support.

    You just got dibs on the alpha. I hope it was obvious we're working it now. I realize I'll have to show the goods to earn real support.

    I'm excited to show you what we're working on, but it's going through a couple of key iterations this week. I'd like to finish the mold on the interface, and work through how any given visitor may interact with the site.

<p><b>*update*:</b> Additional market research revealed that the moving sale market wasn't quite ready for mobile interfaces or a more technology driven market, and after a gut check neither my cofounder nor I was passionate enough to push through and own the transformation of the garage sale industry. </p>
<h2>The 15 Second Pitch:</h2>
<p><strong>The bulk of the classified market can and WILL be tied to location and interest. With GarageDollar we will develop and execute this model at scale with optimal speed and efficiency</strong></p>
<p><em>Mr. &amp; Mrs. Money, Shake Up Your Thousand Dollar Pens and Get Ready to Swing for the Stadium Lights </em></p>
<p>I'll be refining my pitch and knocking on doors until year end, or we lock in sufficient funds. Whoever you are, whatever stage of investing you specialize in, this is a deal not to be passed lightly. I strongly believe early investors take the greatest risk and deserve the greatest multiplier in successful outcomes. If you're serious about investing and ready to talk, you can contact me anytime of day or night at messel at victusmedia.com or (six three one) 403-0178 and I'll enthusiastically respond as soon as is humanly possible. I'm located on the east coast an hour out of Manhattan. I'm willing to travel to speak with eager investors.</p>
<h2>The 60 Second Pitch</h2>
<p>Victus Media is on the bleeding edge of web application development. I know there's a market, I see it everyday I walk past cardboard signs, see a local newspaper listing, or craigslist moving sales (which are full of spam). This market is only going to grow with lean times. Rain or shine, towards the end of this year I'll put funding out of my mind, and dive deep into product support and refinement with technical ninja and chief hacker Tyler Gillies. He eats backend servers for breakfast with Steel Technical Chops.</p>

<h2>Personal reasons for urgency, and renewed sense of doing One Thing</h2>
<p><i>Old habits die hard</i></p>
<p>Fear of not having steady income gripped me when my day job vanished. With unemployment rates skyrocketing, and much of my expertise in an area I'm eager to move on from, the image of years of joblessness hit me like a punch in the gut. My wife, my home, my life all felt fragile and at great risk. What kind of man am I, if not self sufficient?</p>
<p><i>Forked Up Beyond All Recognition</i></p>
<p>I reflexively pinged my contacts and friends to see if they had any job opportunities matching my desired work area and skill set. Good news, a couple of friends had information about positions, one of which sounded like an excellent match to my interests (startup biz development). A job matching agency came across my HackerNews post, and requested a current resume.</p>
<p>My resume is gathering cobwebs (people still use them?) so I hacked together an updated version and sent it out. I should have been happy right? But something felt all wrong. Like deja vu, I was aware of a glitch in the matrix. These reactions were all the product of fear. Yielding to fear is the guy I used to be, not the man I've become. I'm hell bent on a mission.</p>
