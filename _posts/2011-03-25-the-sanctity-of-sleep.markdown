    "It surprises me that there aren’t more startups and products which try and mimic the contemplative benefits of rest"

    That is odd, isn't it? There are a few products which try to measure and graph the quality of sleep. A product which could improve the quality of one's sleep, perhaps even reduce the amount of time one needs to spend sleeping, would have huge implications.

  content: "The app doesn't require the browser to be in control. It installs an object
    to the OS, which monitors work on the computer and tracks time spent per app and
    file, including any desktop app and browsers. \n\nYou can block any site for a
    specific time period, or all tagged sites on a per-tag basis. And you can block
    the internet entirely, if that's what you need. \n\nThe app itself shows graphs
    and charts of how you spend your time. It's crazy illuminating. Maybe I'll release
    it someday, but Jawaya beckons...\n\nIn the meantime, the corporate tool (literally
    and figuratively) is RescueTime. "

  content: "By the browser, I meant the user/client. Any app that gets between me
    and an inclination is frustrating. It's just a hoop to jump through, where the
    issue is discipline. \n\nThe feedback and metrics are very cool though, I imagine
    that will be play a major role in self behavior modification when it comes to
    net usage, info, and communication. One could A/B test their time on various sites
    and see how it affects their daily yield, jeez that terminology is starting to
    sound too much like farming a life for \"crops\". F that."

  content: Agreed. I suppose helping folks rest, concentrate, or be more productive
    isn't very monetizable unless your selling Ridlin.

  content: "Thanks Satish, I have not investigated any time saving self monitoring
    software but Charlie suggested they are the biggest player in this area.\n\nSince
    the issue I'm referring to is a lack of discipline, while measurements would help
    make a compelling case to a rational being (ourselves), that issue will only arise
    in a number of other areas if left unchecked. The trouble with spot solutions
    to a lack of discipline is that they're just treating the symptoms. A more holistic
    treatment would involve behavior change in all cases where discipline is an issue.
    \n\nFor myself\n1) I eat meals which are too large and \n2) have an insatiable
    curiosity which drives me to read and experiment without paying attention to time\nThe
    discipline must come from within to shrink meals and resist distraction while
    working with software frameworks, packages, etc."

    rest'

<p>Cloaked deeply within the time-hallowed vestiges of labor, bathed in the daily rigors of life, there is little preparation which yields greater benefit than adequate rest. As the astute reader may have already guessed, this topic is near and dear to my current state of bleary eyed existence. The culprit that instigated my sad situation was a tasty 24oz J&R steakhouse double cut that I just "had to finish". If only I was marginally as dedicated towards more noble pursuits, like transitioning a side project into a primary mission, saving rain forests, combating global warming, or feeding the hungry (hmm).  With little regret, my role as gluttonous dreamer is self selected as I'm born again* each morning.</p>
<p><I>The Antithesis of Serendipity</I></p>
<p>During sleep the level of external distractions is reduced to a peaceful empty set. Not only does the body go into a mode of rejuvenation, but the mind enters a trancelike subconscious processing state. It is within the confines of blissful slumber that we perform deep analysis on the myriad of life's signals in order to make important decisions which are vital to our well being and happiness. </p>
<p>It surprises me that there aren't more startups and products which try and mimic the contemplative benefits of rest^. In a rush to claim eager venture capital, limited attention of news hungry tech journalists, and ultimately paying clients, most entrepreneurs chase after waining attention with deeper social integration, greater engagement, and interruption dressed up as viral sharing. What if the most profound gift a company can offer a client is a break? Perhaps the next startup trend is a form of enhanced silence, carved out of a day deprived of solitary contemplation.</p>
<p>Notes:<br />
*=  To be clear, when I mention born again it is no way referring to a religious experience. Philosophical yes, spiritual maybe, religious hell no :).</p>
<p>^= <a href="http://charliecrystle.com/2011/03/23/the-internet-never-sleeps-or-getting-things-done/">Charlie Crystle</a> developed an app called Focus which monitored and cut off specific communication channels. His instincts are definitely on to something, but the interface demands the browser constantly be in control. Maybe a monitoring app that yields minutes visiting various information or social sites. Do browser histories already store this information? </p>
