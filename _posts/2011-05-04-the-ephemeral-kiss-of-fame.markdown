  content: Pro chops are difficult to bring to bear if nobody knows you have them.
    At least a little fame should go along with it.

    Gotcha, fame in the right circles is necessary to put the skills you have to work, and to build on them.

    That's another issue with startups. The only way to get better and starting businesses is to keep at it. The problem is the shit storm affects people's lives/livelihoods when things goes south due to a lack of experience.

    Maybe once you get enough chops, you should swing out a little towards the flame...

    Being known has it's advantages, but not being able to walk down the street sounds like a pain (that I'll probably never experience, even in my current role as Pope :-)

    For me, I don't want fame, I want freedom. I'd be happy to hide in the shadows forever, just so long as I can indulge my curiosity. If that's useful to others, it would be nice to just give it away ...

  content: You mentioned about the best shot I have at starting a company. One that
    lets talented builders experience freedom in such as way as to maximize their
    productivity, while jiu-jitsuing a fraction of it towards a business need. If
    and when I figure that critical step out I'll give you a call :D

    I was going to try begging. I figured my sign would say:

    "Will code for the betterment of humanity" :-)

  content: "I like this blog a lot.\nThere is something mystic and powerful here.
    \ \n\nUm, it seems lots of artists use \"chops\" till they make it up what they
    consider to be the highest mountain peak.\nWhen they arrive they bask in fame
    and fortune(and sex and drugs) then feel like they have to produce so they make
    something mediocre, and it sells because they are already famous.....at this point
    some quit and ride the whitewater of the wave for the rest of their lives.....other
    true artists and creators are never content and something within them keeps them
    climbing and moving and working, probably because they derive energy from their
    work(paradox?)\nanyways I wish I was famous or rich because right now im broke
    and unknown\ncheers"

  content: "Some folks coast (human nature?) at a certain level, while others keep
    on creating and connecting, because that is what drives them. It's their reason
    for being. Nice.\r\n\r\nYou mentioned you wish you were rich or famous, but what
    you have now is almost no major expenses, and the freedom to search and explore
    for work that brings out your best. Many people (myself included) find themselves
    in good paying careers that they find little meaning doing, it becomes a type
    of financial trap with more expenses, greater job demands, and less satisfaction.
    It's hard to try and shift your lot after a decade or two in one field, but it's
    the only rationale choice."

<p>Fame is a seductive mistress, even a small taste brings us begging back for more. Merely being well known among a few social circles is emotionally satisfying, yet there is an archetype that craves attention above all else. </p>
<p>The attention cult adores fame for a number of reasons, with good odds on <i>cashing in</I> at the top of the list. It takes little imagination to perceive of the dilemma which substantial attention introduces. </p>
<blockquote><p><i>The temptation to cash in on fame is palpable</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Once well known a creative can pursue a conservative path of upgrades and spin offs on prior work, overcoming a number of challenges while doing so. Alternatively she can continue to embrace the same risks that brought her fame in the first place. One of these directions is a steeper ascent towards mastering a craft or style, the other at least temporarily, satisfies the hunger cry of an empty bank account<sup><a href="#notes">1</a></sup>. </p>
<h2>Rebuke adoration of the crowd, embrace expert criticism</h2>
<p>Effortless to say, not so easy in practice. When last I visited this subject, the decision was clear and remains so. With neither fame nor mastery, I choose to cultivate <a href="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2010/12/23/celebrity-or-pro-chops-pick-one/">pro chops</a>. Schedule allowing, I consider any and all work that I'm confident will expand my expertise and repertoire. Credit is not a dominant criteria while developing skill, although a pat on the back never hurts. At present I've got an overloaded schedule, but look forward to having more time available in a couple of months.</p>
