  content: except for one thing, i&#39;m right there with you on this one. the one
    thing - you got the title of the post wrong! it should be "Can Search Discover
    the Spark of Intelligence?". or even better "Search Will Discover the Spark of
    Intelligence!". <br><br>we don&#39;t know what intelligence is, what consciousness
    is. this is freely admitted by many researchers. and the rest demonstrate it by
    putting forth, with great conviction, entirely conflicting definitions and models.
    i find AI thought leaders like to be terrific at PR and lousy at prediction or
    anything other than trivial and derivative insights. specifically Ray Kurzweil,
    Jeff Hawkins, etc.<br><br>so not knowing what intelligence is, makes it tricky
    to create it. except as you point out, the hive will do it for us. as you, i see
    Wikipedia (etc) as a form of new intelligence - much more powerful and accurate
    and useful than the group intelligence of The Market - which actually seems quite
    stupid. but Wikipedia and The Market etc are nothing compared to what will come
    - and likely from the least expected place.<br><br>do you know the Einstein (i
    think but can&#39;t find it now) quote about how to create life? something like
    - mix hydrogen and gravity and wait 14 billion years...

  content: Haha, I hadn&#39;t heard the Einstein quote before but it fits perfectly.
    Good point about the title, I bounced around with several and as usual time forced
    my hand. Really appreciate your point of view on my far out posts (I enjoy writing
    these the most).

<p>Highly profitable attention based business is powered by crack dev teams working at Google and Microsoft (Bing). From the point of view of an outsider looking in, there is a massive shift in resource gravity that has taken only a decade. It is a living example of <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2009/12/21/attention-jiu-jitsu/">attention jiu-jitsu</a>, which leverages human interest towards desired outcomes. In this case the result is ever larger revenue growth and accompanying <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/ladis2009/talks/dean-keynote-ladis2009.pdf">data-centers</a>. The yield of compute center investments are reaped by maintaining <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_intelligence">information superiority</a> in an emerging network economy. The massive information network density may be the perfect environment for a new pattern to emerge. Upon writing this, I can imagine a room full of artificial intelligence researchers laughing at the possibility of accidental intelligence. My counter is that with enough information (energy) density and connectivity, the highly unlikely becomes inevitable. A plausible method leading to identifiable A.I. is to create a rich environment for intelligence to emerge, as opposed to chasing after intelligence by emulation software. A single spontaneous event is enough to change everything.</p>
<p>Organized structure arising from chaos isn't a novel concept in nature. Cosmologists have constructed intricate hypotheses based on circumstantial evidence and measurements of ancient energies (I trust their data much more than my arm chair A.I. ideas, which isn't much). A <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang?wasRedirected=true">popular theory</a> tells a tale about the history of the entire universe. The story heralds the unfolding of super galactic structures, all emerging from a single event of supreme energy density.</p>
<p>I look to life for supporting patterns to my "far out" thought riffs. In the search for technological intelligence, what better place to look than the history of the human species, an incredible biological machine. Evolutionary development shows a marked gain in cognitive abilities (brain size) happening over a relatively short timespan.<br />
<a href="http://neurophilosophy.wordpress.com/2006/08/07/499/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2953" title="htree" src="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/htree.jpg" alt="" width="695" height="873" /></a><br />
By reviewing this tree of species is there evidence of a threshold for connectivity that may give rise to <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience?wasRedirected=true">sentience</a>? Since we don't have enough social analysis of our ancestors (read as: I'm too lazy to research it at the moment) it's tough to judge what was the required neural connectivity to define conscious self awareness. Intelligence is likely a gradual awareness that improves as neural connectivity increases. For example, my dogs are aware, but they're not self aware (as far as I can guess). In my less lucid moments (strong emotional states), I too become less self aware.</p>
<h2>There's Dollar Signs $$ in Knowledge</h2>
<p>Different aspects of decision making are emerging as valued hubs on the web. <a href="http://hunch.com">Hunch</a> and <a href="http://quora.com">Quora</a> are joining accepted knowledge systems like <a class="zem_slink" title="Wikipedia" rel="homepage" href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="Stack Overflow" rel="homepage" href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, and many others. Legacy knowledge systems derive value from organized crowd sourced user contributions. As more systems lead to rich connected data frameworks, users benefit from improved information availability. I look forward to progressive models which reward the extracted value with their user communities, something the gentlemen behind <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2009/09/30/iter8r-organic-crowd-shared-startup/">Iter8r</a> are working on.</p>
<p>Inspired by knowledge systems, <a href="http://victusmedia.com/frankensearch/">frankensearch.appspot.com</a> was my first effort at a real time search mashup. I've been fascinated with various forms of social search since becoming an admitted Net junky over the past 18 months. Since late last year <a href="http://victusmedia.com/">Victus Media</a> has served as an outlet for focusing my efforts on revealing greater user value in social search.</p>
<p>I'll leave off with a great share I got from my friend <a href="http://lmframework.com/blog/">David Semeria</a>, the genius behind the LM Framework. Can you see emerging information patterns in collaborative software development?</p>
