excerpt: "<h2>Fond Farewell friendfeed</h2>\r\nYou'll probably notice the <a class=\"zem_slink\"
  title=\"FriendFeed\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://friendfeed.com\">friendfeed</a>
  embeds are now gone. It is with great regret that I discovered today that <a class=\"zem_slink\"
  title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://facebook.com\">Facebook</a> has
  purchased friendfeed for ~50 million bucks. I'm happy for the dev team (woohoo cash),
  but I can't help but feel there was greater potential for the friendfeed service
  than an early facebook purchase. There are already plans to move some of the founders
  of friendfeed into upper engineering management positions and other developers into
  various supporting roles. With little doubt the friendfeed team will no longer be
  spending their efforts soley on building friendfeed into a stronger social media
  platform. Instead they'll be helping Facebook to grow and move forward."

    examples showed us this fact this week.

  content: this company eating company process is like watching an oscar eat other
    fish in a fishtank. i guess everyone is jockeying for a more secure vantage point,
    this way they have a better lay of the land and their competitors.

<h2>Fond Farewell friendfeed</h2>
<p>You'll probably notice the <a class="zem_slink" title="FriendFeed" rel="homepage" href="http://friendfeed.com">friendfeed</a> embeds are now gone. It is with great regret that I discovered today that <a class="zem_slink" title="Facebook" rel="homepage" href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> has purchased friendfeed for ~50 million bucks. I'm happy for the dev team (woohoo cash), but I can't help but feel there was greater potential for the friendfeed service than an early facebook purchase. There are already plans to move some of the founders of friendfeed into upper engineering management positions and other developers into various supporting roles.

<p>I mentioned not long ago that I'd like to see completely <a href="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2009/07/27/open-social-media-of-the-people-by-the-people-for-the-people/">user owned open social media</a>. Now more than ever I understand the need for such a service.   All the connections and more importantly friendships I've forged online are likely to be affected by my diminished participation in a dying social platform (no firm commitment to continue the service from the friendfeed team). I hope to strengthen many of the social ties that were fairly recent but the <a class="zem_slink" title="Social network" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network">social graph</a> we carry with us is only as good as the people who go out of their way to keep in touch.</p>
<p>Years after college all of my close friends have moved out of the Long Island area. Rising costs combined with limited opportunities literally drove them out of state. I'm familiar with the mass exodus of good friends. Luckily I keep in touch with them via email, a social media platform that's been around a while.</p>
