  content: "[...] our creative potential takes time, and efficiency might demand we
    avoid spending our efforts in a direction that isn&#8217;t directly fruitful or
    actionable. Our schedules should always include a portion of the day that is &#8220;free
    time&#8221;. This [...]"

  content: "Well said. I hadn't seen that post. \nIt seems like social media is inundated
    with Interesting info, at the expense of Important/Actionable for me specifically.
    That's why professional news is different from social news. Although they complement
    each other, they don't replace one another. \nThanks for reading my blog. "

  content: It's a pleasure learning about how you frame relevance, certainly for professional
    news. Enjoy the holidays with family William. Out of curiosity are you attending
    SXSW next year? I missed you in NY for the DC meetup (stuck working late), would
    like to catch up over coffee or lunch. Plus you can tell my wife and I the best
    spots to visit in France :D

<h2>Actionable vs. Interesting Information</h2>
<p>The distinguishing quality of actionable information is that it must be something we can act on in our immediate future. Action isn't exclusively limited by:</p>
<ul>
<li>building something</li>
<li>making money</li>
<li>disrupting something</li>
</ul>
<p>It could be</p>
<ul>
<li>disseminating further info</li>
<li>improving information system speed</li>
<li>adding valuable descriptive (or meta) information to existing data<a id="more"></a><a id="more-1223"></a></li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, interesting information we are drawn to now, but may not be actionable until some later unforseen time. Then there's the last bin of not interesting, nor actionable information (noise or spam), which we all try to steer clear from.</p>
<p>Our <a class="zem_slink" title="Social network" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network">social graph</a> or network loosely bounds one channel for our actionable information input. <a href="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2009/04/23/serendipity-the-perfect-solution-you-never-thought-of/">Serendipity</a> has a way of sending actionable information in our direction as we're taking action or researching other areas.</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;">Needle in the Haystack</h2>
<p>Tools that aid in our search for relevant actionable information while we're productive transcend boosting our effectiveness. In addition they'll even help us when we're just reading or learning for fun. Social Media has driven the information flood to our doorsteps. Scanning hundreds of blogs, articles, and video topics suggested by friends, becomes a dangerous time sink even when our friends share our interests.</p>
<p>Myself and others are actively working on tools to help discover actionable and interesting information and discern between the two based on a user's past social media usage, blogging, digital shadow. We not only want to filter the noise but to classify new data as immediately important versus something of interest that we may consume at our leisure.</p>
