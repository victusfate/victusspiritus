  content: 'As weird as this sounds, I think anonymity should be considered a basic
    fundamental human right. Perhaps the middle point is that anonymous accounts or
    pseudonyms should be marked as such, so they don''t hold too much sway. But without
    the ability to get stuff out there ''beyond retribution'' there will always be
    some group of people who utilize the circumstances to control others (in both
    negative and positive ways). With anonymity they loose that option, but given
    the nature of control and our history that has proven to be a good thing. '

  content: "Well said, and you're getting to heart of the matter. In order to promote
    liberty, there is a new set of rights that we should be aware of. \r\n\r\nI never
    liked the bill of rights because it limited what liberty one should have, so having
    one for digital identities doesn't sound appealing. But by recognizing the elements
    of free systems we can make apparent networks which strip away at personal freedoms."

<p>Early this morning I browsed across an update from <a href="https://plus.google.com/117421021456205115327/posts/c1LPLyy6nm2">Marshall Kirkpatrick</a> sharing that Google doesn't allow anonymous identities on it's social service Google+.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<a href="https://plus.google.com/117421021456205115327"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011/07/marshall_kirkpatrick_photo.jpg" alt="" title="marshall_kirkpatrick_photo" width="48" height="48" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-9742" /></a><a href="https://plus.google.com/117421021456205115327">Marshall Kirkpatrick</a> - So Google Plus is a place of public discourse, with gradations of privacy, but with no anonymity or pseudonyms (allowed)? How Google-like; I'm not so sure that's a good thing.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I can understand why social web utilities want to attach an account to an identity to promote responsible usage and reputation, but I feel like these goals can be achieved while still allowing pseudonyms for progressive discussions. Two comments struck me as influential and characterizing why I value anonymity with digital identity. I've included them below.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<a href="https://plus.google.com/118117111475857300118/posts"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011/07/oscar_froberg_photo.jpg" alt="" title="oscar_froberg_photo" width="48" height="48" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-9742" /><a href="https://plus.google.com/118117111475857300118/posts">Oscar Fr√∂berg</a> - One thing that would be great would be if you could choose a pseudonym for each circle. That way you could for example interact with "internet-people" anonymously but still be available in search to interact with friends under your real name. There are subjects I'd like to be able to discuss which I don't necessarily want perpetuated on the internet under my real name, even if I want it to be a public discussion!

<p>You won't get whistle blowers, people fighting oppressive regimes, or FakeSteveJobs or DeathstarPR here. I think g+ is lessened by that.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of my favorite social networks condone pseudonyms and various levels of anonymity. Both Twitter and Disqus enable accounts to exist without forcing them to be exposed as belonging to a specific individual.</p>
