<p><i>a Han Solo inspired title for a post that dips into the spiritual side</I></p>
<p>Have you ever experienced moments where you felt unstoppable? </p>
<p>I'm not talking about run of the mill mania, a bloated ego, or a positive feeling of well being. What I refer to is a state of being where all our cylinders fire syncronously. In this state we're so deep in the flow that we can't imagine leaving it. Our thoughts and actions can flow without hindrance. There's this humbling sensation of immense strength that is remarkable because <i>it emanates from us</i>.</p>
<p>It is us. </p>
<p>The sensation of self truth is an aspect of our persona that's untarnished by doubt. This is the song of life that is in harmony with our own inner tune. Forgive the new age mumbo jumbo spiritual speak, and think about the precious nature of these moments. There is no stronger signal I can imagine than our honest subconscious needs emitting every ounce of endorphins to echo "this is the way, go forward".</p>
<p>If you can relate to these moments of self truth, unfettered by the noise of distraction, you can align your life to cultivate stronger and deeper moments. The power of this recurring look into who we are, is much more than a feeling of elation or confidence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your ability to make important decisions is superb. Without the distraction of unimportant tasks, all of our minds processing ability can be leveraged to best estimate changing states and predict likely futures. For developers reading this, you can relate to a fluctuation in your or your colleagues ability to analyze technical challenges. I believe this is a related phenomena</li>
<li>This purposeful and peaceful aura is infectious. Imagine a meme that instills flow, confidence and truth to all that adopt it. I'm beginning to understand the strength and draw of religions now, although I strongly disagree with their rigidity/control. The acceptance of self truth is dynamic and personal. It's hard for me to even properly describe this feeling, your interpretations likely differ</li>
<li>Mental barriers and limits are clearly visible as self built constructs. Their strength in stopping you from pursuing a fantastic path comes only from your belief. As you inspect this faith with a clear mind, you are able to verify the reality of a limitation</li>
<li>Energy, enthusiasm, and joy are in great abundance. The miracle of your existence is founded upon millions of years of impossible odds being overcome. You have no idea what you're really capable of until your motives are made perfectly clear, and all of your vitality is focused on a single goal</li>
</ul>
<p>Or they could just be delusions of grandeur ;)</p>
