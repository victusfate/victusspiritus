This morning while scanning Feedly I came across a post by Brad Feld discussing the importance of <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2011/03/deciding-not-to-do-something.html">deciding not to do something</a>. In it Brad mentions passing up an attractive offer, and it reminded me of an earlier post I'd written on <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2010/09/28/emptiness/">emptiness</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>I cleared a few dozen rows of space at the top of my to do list. I immediately felt more relaxed. Now each time I sit down to work, Iâ€™m greeted with a comforting blank space above my to do list. I decided this silly practice of prioritizing calmness over tasks is worth sharing. We master utilization of information by shaping the spaces that surround it. Only then are we free from the visual noise of distractions.</p></blockquote>
<p>We're only given one lifetime with an uncertain duration. Each day we have only a limited amount of energy, enthusiasm, and focus to wield on shaping our reality. All of our awareness and potential is best served by being fully present in each moment. A Buddhist philosophy is to let go of the past, be mindful of the present, and allow the future to take care of itself. One may spend a lifetime practicing and meditating to achieve that way of life.</p>
<blockquote><p>Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment.<br />
-Buddha</p></blockquote>
<p>I don't think it's a coincidence that a venture capitalist is advising a young entrepreneur with a philosophy that overlaps well with Buddhist beliefs. We're all trying to find a better way to live, to cherish the gifts we've been given. One way we express our gratitude and reverence for life is by choosing a path and walking it. Not only are we more effective by concentrating our participation, but we project a clear and vibrant signal to those around us that our time is precious and we won't easily be distracted from our path.</p>
