My good friend <a href="http://steamcatapult.com/">Dave Pinsen</a>, an entrepreneur and financial wiz, reminded me of my situation very clearly with a comment yesterday.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2010/08/20/how-i-lost-my-startups-first-90k-client-and-won-my-freedom/#comment-70358150"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4938" title="DavesComment" src="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DavesComment.png" alt="" width="536" height="416" /></a><em>There is no turning back</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My old day job is a heap of burning wreckage. The only path forward is the one I carve for myself. You can't simulate dire consequences to induce desperation, it has to be real. The amazing and frightening thing about having your back against the wall, you realize just what kind of person you are. I'm far more ruthless than I would have liked to believe. Now I need to harness that cut throat persona towards a profitable direction.</p>
