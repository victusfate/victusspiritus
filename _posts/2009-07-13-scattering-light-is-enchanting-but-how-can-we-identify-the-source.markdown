  shade of crimson this week as the fallout from a Russian volcano blast hits the
  UK. Millions of tonnes of dust, ash and sulphur dioxide were thrown up to 30 miles
  into the air when Sarychev Peak on Matua Island in the Kuril Archipelago erupted
  last month. The blast created what experts call a ‘volcanic aerosol’ - a colourful
  mixture of ash and sulphur compounds - in the stratosphere.</blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:

  we can only see the scattered effect of people applying their own perspectives to
  an original source of information. Bloggers, commenters,  and social media users
  all add their own point of view to events as they take place and become documented
  in our shared global information repository. It's beautiful to witness the scintillating
  analyses shared by interacting nodes (individuals &amp; crowd sourced sites). But
  we are challenged with understanding the source of truth behind all the glittering
  lights. Thousands of individual voices can be describing similar events and trends
  but remain disconnected due to different languages or choice of terms."

<p style="text-align: left;">In comes semantic interpreters. Behind all the rays of light and photons there is a trail that leads back to the meta data, the volcanic eruption. This is the raw common event, product, or gathering that ties all the divergent conversations together. From many millions of opinions and observations essential information is extracted and shared. We become more knowledgeable on the whole, if only we can piece the fragmented conversations together. It is beyond any single dust particle to have knowledge of all the nuances of scattered light from the source, just as it is beyond any single person or organization to understand the sum total of all internet perceptions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We are challenged to manifest magnifiscent tools to make sense of the relentless information stream. Perhaps only collectively, all of humanity may understand the nature of the source of events, and truly harness the collaborative power of billions of minds and their technologies working together.</p>
