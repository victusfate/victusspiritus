  His Photos</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Should We Give Our Best Away for Free?</h2>\r\nFor several
  months I've been persuading readers (preaching) to discover work that compliments
  their passions. My fear is that the process of monetizing detracts from our best
  message. Any truly great work, be it art, functional or a mix, that comes from the
  core of our being and needs to be passed on has great value (at least to ourselves).
  But the manner of trying to cost that, profit, or putting a price tag on our creations
  may tarnish the work. It's a healthy fear to keep in mind, as it channels creative
  energies towards coming up with revenue streams that doesn't sully our integrity,
  honesty, and genuine judgement."

  content: Would it be more powerful for the advertising to target each and every
    reader of your blog as opposed to just the context of what you&#39;re writing?
    This would probably be possible if a person is logged in using their Twitter/Facebook
    account. I guess this would be some sort of personal contextual advertising.

  content: That&#39;s the idea, those social media blocks on the right hand side could
    very well have dynamic information from readers. <br><br>But what I didn&#39;t
    capture in the mock up  was the addition of comments. Those could just as easily
    feed into the advertising semantic engine and generate pertinent ads to the right
    of this reply. ----&gt;<br><br>Also the same engine could work on friendfeed&#39;s
    homepage, or twitter&#39;s homepage, or interfaces to these social media. Competing
    algorithms can be developed to derive meta data from natural typing language from
    all the big players (Google, Microsoft, facebook, twitter, friendfeed, etc.) The
    most relevant matchers will win and so will I :D

  content: I like it. With so much public data available about individuals (i.e. what
    they tweet, who they follow and who follows them, the RSS feeds they subscribe
    to, etc.) combined with the information on what they are currently reading (i.e.
    your blog, or their Twitter page, or FriendFeed, etc.) you could build a powerful
    personal contextual ad engine.

  content: That&#39;s right Fred. Anytime I do a search, Google/Microsoft etc advertises
    to my text query. Why not do the same every time I tweet (in a similar non-intrusive
    fashion).  That&#39;s step one.<br><br>Step two would be for a page like my blog
    (the mockup). You&#39;d be advertising to anyone who happened to be on the page
    based on the page content (tweets, friendfeed statuses, comments), but if the
    readers are interested in the conversations happening, they may be interested
    in the same suggested links. If I&#39;m reading Robert Scoble&#39;s status about
    how awesome autopilot is on his prius, or how cool your scooter is, maybe I&#39;d
    be interested in some ads targeting those products/keywords.<br><br>Step 3 would
    be building up personalized profiles to learn about the tweeter and make even
    relevant suggestions (Vlad and I hashed it above this comment some).

  content: I also believe that true utility lies in combining the data used for all
    three steps. It makes sense that by knowing what a person tweets, what tweets
    a person reads, and what blogs (larger conversations) a person takes part in,
    that the advertiser can build a very strong profile to build quite useful contextual
    ads.

  content: By all means, excellent point. The combination of a users history, who
    they follow, who they interact with can all be leveraged to give them the most
    effective ads. I think this is a later step, we can probably get an early version
    working in a matter of days. I&#39;m trying to contact Paul Buchheit of friendfeed,
    and Matt Mullenweg of Wordpress to gauge their interest. I assume Fred can contact
    key people in twitter to see if they&#39;re already on a similar path. All of
    social media providers could benefit from this type of structure.

    that they could certainly help with applying what they do along with Thaya to
    help build something on your framework.<br><br>On the content producers side,
    I have been thinking about how they can be rewared in terms of an ad revenue share

<h2>Should We Give Our Best Away for Free?</h2>
<p>For several months I've been persuading readers (preaching) to discover work that compliments their passions. My fear is that the process of monetizing detracts from our best message. Any truly great work, be it art, functional or a mix, that comes from the core of our being and needs to be passed on has great value (at least to ourselves). But the manner of trying to cost that, profit, or putting a price tag on our creations may tarnish the work. It's a healthy fear to keep in mind, as it channels creative energies towards coming up with revenue streams that doesn't sully our integrity, honesty, and genuine judgement.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-507"></a></p>
<p>raw recording of some thoughts on giving our best away for free:[podcast]http://www.victusspiritus.com/audio/MaybeWeShoudlGiveAwayOurBestForFree.mp3[/podcast]</p>
<p>As you might have guessed, I've spent (<a href="#AdditionalInformation">insert large amount of time here</a>) thinking about different monetization models for internet content/products. One of the core concepts is centered about "how best to connect internet communication tools to businesses". The importance of this priority has been recognized by <a href="http://scobleizer.com/">Robert Scoble</a>. His vision for <a href="http://www.building43.com/">building43</a>, manifests the principle clearly "<em>make it easier for businesses to use the internet to improve their business results</em>".</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/06/clearing-something-up"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-789" title="FredTalksAboutLinkDollars" src="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/FredTalksAboutLinkDollars.jpg" alt="FredTalksAboutLinkDollars" width="500" height="375" /></a>The post from Fred (click image for link) got the neurons firing (thanks to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonnygoldstein/">Jonny Goldstein</a>)</p>
<p>Fred Wilson's #140conf conference talk</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="520" height="303" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="src" value="http://blip.tv/play/AYGJ+m2JoHg" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="520" height="303" src="http://blip.tv/play/AYGJ+m2JoHg" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/06/my-140conference-talk.html#comment-11497466">My response</a> to Fred's post suggests "an advertisement window/column (very Googlish) based upon the meta data (semantic) of passed links" :</p>
<blockquote><p>Very excited about monetization potential for not only social media (facebook/twitter/friendfeed) but for web content in general. The economy of the internet is evolving. I labelled gratitude as the virtual currency in social media, but that is usually shown with thanks and a link.<br />
I'm worried about one hiccup. If passed links are the currency, how will advertising piggy back on them. Anytime I'm paid to refer something, my genuine recommendation has had all it's value removed.</p></blockquote>
<p>A series of comments and replies lead to this <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/06/clearing-something-up.html#comment-11044338">early idea</a> of mine:</p>
<blockquote><p>I agree the contextual advertising isn't there yet. But imagine if you will, updating your status on any social media you frequent. Now imagine a small box off to the side with pertinent advertising targeting the semantic meaning of your status update. For an analogy, I can lookup up dentists on Google and find one locally without ever looking at their ads (above or on the side). The same can be done within social media, I can search for a preferred dentist and ignore any ads they may have (above or on the side), plus I can get first person descriptions and feedback. The technology is rapidly developing and Google, twitter, facebook amongst other businesses are doing their best to match the semantic meaning of your searches or status updates to an appropriate advertisement/business (if they're not they should be). See my comment about where pageviews are coming from to my blog, they're almost all (95-100%) social media sourced referrers. <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2009/04/21/ad-money-will-play-follow-the-leader-to-the-king-of-links/">Advertising dollars will follow the link passers</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the creator of <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com">balsamiq</a> for this awesome mockup (big thanks Giacomo 'Peldi' Guilizzoni)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.balsamiq.com"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-818" title="MonetizationSampleFromBalsamiq" src="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/MonetizationSampleFromBalsamiq.png" alt="MonetizationSampleFromBalsamiq" width="525" height="440" /></a></p>
<h2><a name="AdditionalInformation"></a></h2>
<p>Maybe the ads should be personalized to only the users updates/status. Mixed feelings on this, if you're reading Scobles lifestream you might just be persuaded to get a Prius. I've wanted one for a while (4years) but Robert's great feedback could be the tipping point. The advertising algorithm will have to "know me" in a historical data sense. Data a <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2009/05/24/do-you-perceive-a-need-for-a-virtual-web-representation-of-yourself/">virtual assistant</a> would have easily be able to provide.</p>
<p>Check out 18.5minutes in to <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/06/fridays-chat-with-howard.html">Fred's Friday chat with Howard Lindzon</a> for some extra thoughts on where twitter may go for monetization.</p>
