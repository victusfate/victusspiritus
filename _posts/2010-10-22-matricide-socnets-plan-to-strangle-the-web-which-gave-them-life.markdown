  content: "I think what they meant is that we're entering a phase where \"peer-to-peer\"
    is going to become more prevalent, and I agree with that view. \nWe are becoming
    more networked via the social web as individuals, and the sum of these peer-to-peer
    networks is going to become larger than the bi-directional links.   \nWe started
    talking about P2P back in 2001, and I used to run a community blog called Peer
    Intelligence back then. Now, P2P is being realized."

  content: I wish that were the case William but based on how their companies monetize
    I'm not sure how they can push in that direction. Much like Apple in pursuit of
    quality they'll fight to remain in the center between you and whoever you contact
    over their network. As bloggers and commenters we can already route around centralized
    networks but return to them for access to specific friends and news.I'm working
    to support development of distributed social projects like couchappspora (a couchdb
    distributed social tool that's working towards Ostatus/<a href="http://status.net"
    rel="nofollow">status.net</a> compliance). I believe strongly that disintermediating
    centralized social layers is where we will end up in a few years.

  content: "Exactly re: last point. \r\nDo we need FB the destination if we can have
    its network effect otherwise? \r\n\r\nAnd will Apps On Twitter (eg stocktwits,
    hashable) and Apps In Facebook (social games, what else??) be more valuable than
    the network themselves."

<p>This post was instigated by MG Siegler's <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/21/pincus-web-connections/">Tech Crunch coverage</a> of the Kleiner Perkins $250 million dollar Social Fund (sFund). What fired me up is a quote from Mark Pincus that discloses the direction of web born yet anti-web properties: </p>
<blockquote><p>
In five years, everybody will always be connected to each other, instead of the web
</p></blockquote>
<p>What the hell does that even mean? Will Amazon, Facebook, and Zynga forego communication via HTTP in favor of proprietary, authorized only formats? </p>
<p>Did I miss the memo on the new corporate speak for direct connection? By definition <i>direct connectivity</I> is inconsistent with third party corporate intermediaries which have knowledge and control of the content of messages. Not only that, the intermediaries have deep personal information on the sender, the recipients, and their social networks. I would define this form of connectivity as highly indirect.</p>
<p>Initially I suspect Mark I, II & III* are interested in being the Internet's version of a new phone company based on the dial tone reference. I don't see how the social web can be an impartial corporate dial tone without being regulated into worthlessness. Without regulation this form of corporate backbone is an obvious monopoly. </p>
<p>We haven't even finished disrupting the last wave of BigTelco discrimination or achieved cost per bit parity. Why would evolutionary tech forces select for proprietary corporate bottlenecks for one to one, one to many, or many to many connections? That's just reverting to an old form, and we've been down that road before and it sucked (AT&T, AOL, MSN, IE).</p>
<p><I>It's natural for superior child technologies to disrupt incumbent systems</I></p>
<p>I'm pro child tech disruption when it's superior to its predecessors. It's not clear how society benefits from having only a few corporate choices for communication. While limited choice enables rapid integration, placing all the responsibility of communication in the hands of a single corporate entity is foolish if we desire any kind of network stability or security. </p>
<p>Nature selects many parallel paths to achieve stability, in software we call this "there's more than one way to do it".</p>
<p>Notes:<br />
*= Jeff is Mark I of these webpreneurs and based on corporate age that makes Zuck II and Pincus III. Looking forward to the real world of Mark I, II + Bezos. Remember you heard it here first</p>
<p>Joking and hippy rant aside, I have a lot of respect for what these gents have accomplished so far. But I disagree with many of their core strategies and vision for the future of communication. As an ego check and to put my opinion in perspective, they're all pretty loaded and I'm struggling for lunch money. </p>
