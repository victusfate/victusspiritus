<p>If you're interested in learning more about using CouchDB then you've come to the right place. Max Ogden recently joined <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a> and has a gift for introducing complicated concepts in an approachable manner. Who would have thought taco databases would be so fun :)? </p>

<a href="http://vimeo.com/18808177">Get friendly with CouchDB</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/maxogden">Max Ogden</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>Another Code for America fellow <a href="http://www.chachaville.com/content/intro-couchdb">Chacha Sikes took notes on the talk</a>. The most awesome part of the talk for me was discovering the <a href="http://mens.de/:/couchdbref">Antepenultimate CouchDB Reference Card (cheat sheet)</a>. This guide is the ultimate DM screen (reference for you old school dungeon and dragons players) with incredibly handy reference material, all at your finger tips. Thanks to <a href="http://blog.fupps.com/2010/04/20/the-antepenultimate-couchdb-reference-card/">Jan-Piet Mens</a> for his work putting it together.</p>
