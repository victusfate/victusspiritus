<p>The question was sent to me by a new friendÂ <a href="http://ihumanable.com/blog/2009/12/weakness/">Matt Nowack</a> as a form of blog chain letter, "What is your greatest weakness?" While I hate chain emails, I see an entirely different angle on this chain as the trail is public, and self revealing.</p>
<h2>My answer is</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2482" title="fberagrr" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2009/12/fberagrr.gif" alt="fberagrr" width="157" height="110" /></p>
<ul>
<li>I'm afraid of being a coward</li>
<li>I'm afraid of saying no, even when it's a damn good idea</li>
<li>I'm afraid of losing my temper, and looking like a jackass</li>
<li>I'm afraid of cackling madly out loud (I do this too often), at inappropriate moments that no one else finds humor in, but I find hilarious</li>
<li>I'm afraid of letting go</li>
<li>I'm terrified of unhinging all the mental locks that keep me well behaved and socially acceptable</li>
<li>I'm afraid of being totally raw, genuine, and myself at all times</li>
<li>I'm afraid of what people think of me, I can feel negative judgement and it angers me</li>
<li>I'm afraid of showing too much affection for friends in public</li>
<li>I'm afraid of writing what I really think, unfiltered all the time</li>
<li>I'm afraid of giving every ounce and fiber of my being, because I still may fail</li>
<li>I'm afraid of failure</li>
<li>I'm afraid of great success, only to find out I'm just another worthless self absorbed asshole</li>
<li>I'm afraid of walking down the dock, into the unknown ocean and never coming back to who I used to be</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm continuing this chain by inviting friends to reveal their greatest weaknesses: <a href="http://vukicevic.blogspot.com/">Vladimir Vukicevic</a>, and <a href="http://wolfsongs.com/2009/12/what-is-my-greatest-weakness/">Terence Reilly</a></p>
<p>Chain originators: (so far I'm most impressed with Matt's fear, the rest sound like advantages!)</p>
