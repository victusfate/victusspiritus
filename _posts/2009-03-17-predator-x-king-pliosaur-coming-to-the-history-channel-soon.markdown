<p>Jorn H. Hurum, paleontologist from the University of Oslo, directed the excavations in 2008 to recover the bones of "Predator X" found on the Arctic island of Svalbard, a low priority on my planned vacations.</p>
<p>So what's the big deal, it's another dinosaur right?  Wrong, this thing is touted to be one of the most ferocious creatures ever, with a bite wielding a projected 33,000lbs per square inch, dwarfing the T-Rex's 3000lb per square inch jaw power.  Modern day alligators can crank 2,500lbs per square inch and that's more than enough to leave a mark.  Not to forget mentioning, but it's physiology supported a four flipper TURBO-CHARGE characteristic, enabling it to move with lethal speed in bursts.</p>
<p>If you're a carnivorous water dino (marine reptile) fan you're in luck, the  History Channel Predator X Premiere is later this month and the internet is a buzz trying to shake down more details on this topic.  For more information check my <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/PredatorX">Predator X Info Page</a>.</p>
