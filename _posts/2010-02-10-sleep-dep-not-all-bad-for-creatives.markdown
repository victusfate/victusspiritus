  content: 'I read this Wednesday night, when I didn&#39;t get much done because I
    was sleep-deprived and was a little skeptical of it. The next day, Thursday night,
    I was still sleep-deprived, but after a short nap ended up weaving a Star Trek:
    TNG metaphor into an e-mail, and later, a <a href="http://steamcatapult.com/2010/02/11/star-trek-tng-and-portfolio-armor/"
    rel="nofollow">post</a> about a technical issue related to my new site. I don&#39;t
    know if that&#39;s a good or bad post, at this point, but I don&#39;t think I
    would have broken out the TNG metaphor had I been fully-rested. <br><br>So maybe
    there was something to your post here after all.'

  content: You have some living evidence that it&#39;s not all good. Some of those
    bad ideas are better off D.O.A. I&#39;d prefer coding/writing with a good nights
    sleep, but often I don&#39;t have that luxury and come up with the strangest things.

  content: "[...] Sleep Dep not all bad for creatives [...]"

<p>The prevalence of <a HREF="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation?wasRedirected=true">sleep deprivation</a> is evident in our massive market for coffee and other stimulants. Although our <a href="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/1690">mind requires rest</a> to maintain peak functionality, we make do by relying on stimulants to simulate wakefulness. A regular lack of sleep results in weight gain and reduced decision making ability. In extreme cases sleep deprivation can be terminal, but thats only under extraordinary circumstances.  </p>
<p>Despite the obvious negatives, there is a noticeable advantage to the sleep deprived conscious state. For creative work, the mind becomes much less self inhibited. The same cognitive forces that diminish our critical reasoning, may also allow easier access to our subconscious and imagination. </p>
<p>My personal experience of this effect is an improved sense of creativity, immediately following an interrupted sleep cycle. While many ideas I cook up are terrible, I'm much less likely to instantly discard a new opportunity. I'll spend more time exploring the potential for a tool or application because of a shift in my perception. Normal cognitive biases that blind me from a novel solution are temporally diminished. But these same biases also prevent a large fraction of "noise" ideas from ever reaching my attention, so there's a tradeoff. Cognitive biases act as a filter or barrier to the storm of terrible ideas that never receive more than a cursory thought. Distraction appears coupled to the creative boost we can harness from altered sleep.</p>
