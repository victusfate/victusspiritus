  lies gleaning trends and user patterns/clusters from the database."

<h2>Where's Database Tech Headed?</h2>
<p>This three part post starts with a simple discussion of databases and a <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/07/hacker-news-and-the-nosql-movement.html">tip of the hat from Fred Wilson to the Hacker News Community</a>.

<h2>Death Makes Us Aware That Each Moment is Precious</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.kk.org/2009/07/futurama-death-clock.php">Kevin Kelly inspired Death Clock</a> appeared in <a class="zem_slink" title="Matt Groening" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Groening">Matt Groening</a>'s Futurama. The device predicts the life time of the user. Morbidly fearing our demise, or putting too much faith into a death clock, is not what Kevin suggests (or Matt Groening makes light of). While a rather short post based on Kevin's standards, it's message is clear. We only have so much time on the merry go round before we have to get off. Kevin has his Death Clock displayed in his desktop background, not as a grim reminder of his mortality, but that each of his moments is precious, and is a non-renewable resource. We are reminded that living like we have forever to accomplish our dreams can be a dangerous gambit.</p>
<h2>Reality Distortion Fields, Caveat emptor</h2>
<p>Finally <a href="http://steveblank.com/2009/07/02/rocket-science-2-drinking-the-kool-aid/">Steve Blank warns us of Drinking the Kool-Aid</a>. While an Entrepreneur-in-Residence (a sweet position by Steve's standards) he experienced "the single most compelling speech" he and the VC he was working with have ever heard from fellow <a href="http://steveblank.com/category/supermac/">SuperMac</a> veteran Peter Barrett. Not long after Steve was hired as the CEO of the $4 million dollar venture to be the "adult supervision and administrative overseer" of the startup and he was generous enough to share a few of his lessons learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your level of due diligence should be commensurate with your position in the company and proportional to the reality distortion field of the presenter</li>
<li>Never join (or start) a company whose business model you can’t draw</li>
<li>Subjects in which you are not a domain expert always sound exciting</li>
<li>Sleep on any major decision</li>
</ul>
<p>My comment back to Steve:</p>
<blockquote><p><a class="zem_slink" title="Reality distortion field" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field">Reality distortion field</a> isn’t that the basic technique covered in startups 101? I just assumed the distortion field must be propagated until it meets reality with widespread adoption. <strong>If entrepreneurs can’t imagine and convince us that we can achieve the impossible, who will?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">Failed concepts require the courage to recognize the need for business redirection. I’m sold on people, not their favorite idea of the moment. If long term investors fall prey to UBER pitches, at the very least their investing in a master salesmen- leverage that brilliance in another tractable venture.<br />
Ps: my limited perspective comes with self recognition of a lack of hands on experience</p></blockquote>
<p style="padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">What I take away from this:</p>
<ul>
<li>due diligence is up to the investor
<ul>
<li>as an aspiring entrepreneur, I'd like to think I'd <em>do the due diligence</em> of a concept before even approaching outside investors</li>
<li>better still, if the venture didn't require any outside funding</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I'd like someone with the passion and persuasiveness of Peter Barrett, to be giving the pitch of a solid concept I help put together</li>
</ul>
