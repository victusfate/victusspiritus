    did a post on the best dream sites on the web:<br><a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/the-best-sites-to-share-and-understand-dreams/"

    I really enjoyed it and wished I had spent the effort to create something similar
    after I stopped working on Dreamsnare.<br><br>Small world :)

<h2>Dreamsnare</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.dreamsnare.com/">Dreamsnare</a> was my first web community concept, but the forums there never really took off with shared dream interpretation and eventually only the occasional spam bot visited so I took down the message board. If I do rekindle a shared dream interpretation community, it will be using a great social media support framework like a Drupal community book.</p>
<p>Here's a little background about dreamsnare from the landing page:</p>

<p>When I was working on Dreamsnare I realized editing the pages, and adding new content, to an html site, to be a slow process. I wanted an easier platform, with many more topics than just dreams, and I was hoping to eventually make income doing it. It turns out that the publishing site <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/">Squidoo </a>provided all of this plus internal marketing support.</p>
<h2>Squidoo</h2>
<p>My first lens (each stand alone web page) on Squidoo, <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/money-love-1">The Profit Prophet</a> has an odd url. It's called money-love-1 as this was my first title, but I later changed it. In it I discuss why we pursue worldly wealth:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; ">To enjoy the fruits of a free society, financial independence is of vital importance. Without it, your perspective will always be clouded by the necessity to "pay the bills". You'll do things in opposition to your life's passion for a paycheck, and this will cause internal conflict and disharmony. Over the years your childhood dreams of driving your own destiny will wither and fade. The overriding purpose of this page is to inspire self directed change. I'll discuss a little of what my definition of a Profit Prophet is as well.</p>
<p>I had a bunch of fun writing up squidoo pages covering a diverse set of topics:</p>

<h2>Where am I now?</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">If you're still with me, awesome. Near the end of my new squidoo lens days, I found that I could write on my own platform. Tweaking the webpages and site however I desired. From this early idea, <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/">Victus Spiritus</a> was born. I started at typepad but eventually moved the blog to it's own domain a month or so later. From my perspective Wordpress (thanks <a href="http://ma.tt/">Matt Mullenweg</a> &amp; <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>) gives much more flexibility to users on a hosted domain over my original typepad setup.</span></p>
<h2>Communities...</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px; background-color: #ffffff;">I think my digital shadow of web communities will have to wait for another post.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px; background-color: #ffffff;"></p>
