  content: "Change is great....run with it.\n\nHonestly, I really like this post and
    the thoughts behind this.\n\nThere is a difference between a strong and creative
    point of view (like yours) focusing daily on what's top of mind.\n\nand \n\nA
    strong point of view (creative, smart, edufocused--like yours) digging and focusing
    on the underlying focus of your biz or your way into the tech world.\n\nYou can
    argue that these are simply difference of emphasis. Difference of focus is everything.\n\nI
    look forward to what's next my friend. "

  content: "This is the way I see it Mark, it's not writers block, it's thinkers freedom.\n\nThink
    about \"thinkers freedom\" from an inverse McLuhan's tetrad.  The tetrad looks
    at the effects of technology in society, but in your case it what are the effects
    of thinking in your blog.\n\n<b>McLuhan's Laws of Media</b>\nhttp://www.horton.ednet.ns.ca/staff/scottbennett/media/\n\nMcLuhan
    outlines\nENHANCE\nREVERSE\nRETRIEVE\nOBSOLESCE\n\nInstead of thinking of this
    as what technology does, think of the inverse \n\n1. What enhances your thinking?\n2.
    What can be found in the reverse of your thinking?\n3. What can you retrieve again
    from the past?\n4. What is obsolete and in becoming obsolete what is new?\n\nIn
    terms of ENHANCE - is there a fresh dimension, a new way of looking at things?
    (that is certainly evident in your recent posts.) \nIn term of REVERSE - what
    expectations reversed into something entirely unexpected or different, what is
    the unintended consequence?\nIn terms of RETRIEVE - what gems are sitting in the
    past that in the new light of day and personal growth, can enlighten old thoughts\nIn
    terms of OBSOLETE - what is the metamorphism replacing, what is being done away
    with, no longer relevant or necessary?\n\nMy approach is thinking out aloud rather
    than writing or even serving.  It can go on and on because in my case there really
    is no destination.  That is true today as it was a decade ago.  Under my original
    \"Mark Zorro\" exploration I once created a blog called the <i>\"The Chamber of
    Self Expression\"</i> - the tongue in cheek membership criteria of it was that
    any member that joined agreed to leave.  When I got letters from Yahoo saying
    they are going to shut the blog down due to lack of members, it was time to do
    something different.  \n\n<b>CoSE - Chamber of Self Expression</b>\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/Self-expressed/?yguid=74425450\n\nThe
    irony is that 90% of my online content is no longer online because I chose to
    spend time at what I thought were larger forums, and yet that original Yahoo page
    keeps on trucking, Yahoo never carried out their threat - and yet when the larger
    blogs deleted their communities, it was simply a movement on different, if not
    better things.\n\nThe ultimate question of thinking isn't simply the stuff we
    leave behind, but identifying what is core to us, what we enjoy doing, what keeps
    us in flow and sometimes even the radical decision of not doing anything.  There
    are two aspects which are my humble opinion, that I put out for food for thought\n\n1.
    TRANSITION\n2. BANDWIDTH\n\n<b>LIFE IN TRANSITION</b>\nThere will always come
    times in one's life when things start feeling unstuck, not right, or confusing
    and this is something I consider to be a natural part of growth.  It is a transition
    moment.  It is a moment where one moves from one level of comprehension to another
    level of understanding.  You may be going through a moment of transition, what
    Ram Charan describes as a turning point.  In most cases this can be related to
    having spent so long on something, that a new thing is emerging - I do not consider
    the 10,000 hours effect discussed by Malcolm Gladwell, a fanciful idea - I think
    there is a lot to it, and I call it TRANSITION.\n\n<b>BANDWIDTH CAPACITY</b>\nThe
    firehose of information one confronts may be creating bandwidth issues.  Especially
    when one has reached a transition point in their life (the mere fact that you
    talk about metamorphis maybe a clue to this i.e. it isn't the blog which is metaphoring,
    it might be you).  In this case what one focuses on can create an additional moment
    where some information isn't really core to where one is at.  The art of managing
    our bandwidth is welcoming change, but also accepting that natural growth maybe
    happening, and one needs to appreciate this uncertainty as such.  \n\nAnyway,
    you know I can write several more paragraphs, but if its bandwidth and transition
    which are relevant right now, I better stop :-)\n\nRegards\n<b>[Em]</b>\n\"Emeri

  content: "The two highlights this week for me were a conversation I had with JLM
    at avc.com blog called \"Fifty\" and then there was that utter singular class
    act which happens to be one of your tweets\n\n<b>Tweet regarding Fernando</b>
    \nhttps://twitter.com/#!/VictusFate/status/105762118418186240\n\nThe act of that
    single tweet and the conversation with JLM both possess the same underlying property,
    that the act of writing is an act of living.  Just because we don't use a keyboard
    or a pen does not mean that we have not inscribed something more powerful than
    the pen.\n\nTo help a fellow human being out is worthy of mention because then
    one isn't writing a blog, one is writing in the book of life itself.  What greater
    authorship is there in this world than that.\n\nUp to this point I had been wrestling
    with whether I should be following you on Twitter under the auspices of \"Emeri
    Gent\" or under the auspices of \"Rupy Yuan\".  There is no question in my mind
    that I am following you in the appropriate digital tribe.  \n\nWhile \"Emeri Gent\"
    is the relationship between me and a group of emergence, \"Rupy Yuan\" is the
    relationship between me and a group of practical wisdom.  What trumps big thinking
    is practical action.  If we don't execute, we are frankly playing with ourselves
    and not exercising our existence.\n\nWe are all writing something but we don't
    know if it has been written.  That is where emergence is interesting, but the
    relationship that is the glue that grounds things into phronesis, that in my book
    is what closes the loop between mind, spirit, body and life.\n\nHow we achieve
    integration is an end result of looking at things whole, but without those little
    moments of relational genius, what is the point of integrating anything, otherwise
    it's recipes without the final meal.  I think that Fernando Gutierrez will find
    what he is looking for, but how ever he succeeds, the selfless act of helping
    out another human being has to be acknowledged.\n\nThis is called tiny differences,
    which are the little acts that go by generally unnoticed but which make all the
    difference in the world.  Our society is focused on innovation rather than being
    innovative, it promotes making a difference as headlines news, but a tiny difference
    is what really counts - and that difference is the life of the unsung hero - that
    is what makes my heart proud.\n\nYou are writing everyday my friend, and don't
    you forget it :-)\n\nRegards\nM."

    I often find myself reading old posts here and see many of them as exploration and calls to action. Now I've given myself quite a handful of directions to pursue, enough that I no longer am in need of more directions, but instead require distance along one or more of the paths.

    I'll look up your conversation with JLM, I'm sure it will be a rewarding read.

  content: I've been writing almost daily since 1980 when my English teacher made
    a daily journal entry (think blog post on paper, kids) a requirement.  I never
    stopped writing but the frequency and intensity with which I write has.  I've
    found that I can go a goodly stretch of time without writing and then suddenly
    realize that I've been so wrapped up in DOING things that I have forgotten to
    write about them.  As an old dude, I really think that constantly sharing/posting/tweeting
    etc. really gets in the way of actually DOING, but not "doing" writing is inconceivable [Vizzini
    cuts the rope] which is really my Catch 22 and the whole point of this post.  Write
    more when you feel you need to!

<p>Regular visitors to Victus Spiritus have likely realized that my posts here have all but stopped over the past month. I'm not finished writing by a long shot, but this blog has certainly shifted into a new phase. </p>
<p>There's only so much I can effectively contribute to a given topic in a brief interval, and I've worked with that constraint to cover many bite sized ideas over the past few years. Yet that's only an ancillary agent to the shift here. The primary cause is that I simply don't feel the same urgent need to share as much as I used to. </p>
<p>A switch in my mind has flipped, and I'm perfectly satisfied to quietly contemplate ideas without writing or posting them. Put another way, the pattern of blogging is intrinsic to how I think and my hunger for feedback has abated.</p>
<p>It's not that I don't find value in writing each morning, it's been immensely beneficial to my thinking. Daily blogging has been a critical learning tool and method of meeting open minds far sharper than my own, in a variety of fields. With that in mind I've decided to write about ideas and events that I feel compelled to share, but only then.</p>
<h2>Victus Spiritus begins a metamorphosis, what's next?</h2>
<p>I can't predict exactly how often I'll be writing, but I suspect there will be several posts a month. I would like to write more mini series which cover topics in further depth, but break down each topic into manageable segments for both me to write and visitors to read. </p>
<p>I'd also like to concentrate on topics which have a longer half life than popular web tech. In the few dozen web and graphic technologies I've reviewed here in the past, very few are relevant now, and fewer still (if any) will be relevant in a decade. The patterns and meta patterns of development are likely candidates for tech posts, along with general examples of implementations.</p>
