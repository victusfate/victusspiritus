  content: I&#39;ve always figured the problem with the semantic web wasn&#39;t whether
    or not it was technically possible, but whether or not the payback from all of
    the extra work was really worth it for most people. Realistically, just throwing
    up a simple basic web site is enough to utilize the web&#39;s presence. Interconnecting
    that web site with tonnes of other stuff is neat, but does it really draw in that
    many more viewers? Are they there for the data, or just because the site is interesting?
    How long will that last?<br><br><br>Paul.

  content: The semantic web will potentially benefit us by allowing search and more
    intelligent utility of all the great info available on the web. Here&#39;s the
    wikipedia link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web" rel="nofollow">Semantic
    Web</a>. If you check down a bit you can scan through all the potential applications.
    <br><br>My own preferred tools focus on search and relevant ads that are related
    to the intent of a users social interactions online. Over time simple software
    systems can understand our favored topics and simple relationships between those
    topics. This will happen with user assistance and training. There are many technologies
    that are coming together. <br>They&#39;ll have to before I have a functional virtual
    assistant that can scan the web for information relevant to my discussion 3 months
    ago and have it waiting in my input stream. I won&#39;t see ads that I have no
    probability of clicking or acting on.

  content: Sure it&#39;s fine for the researchers wanting to investigate the relationships
    between people and pages, or even the marketers wanting to target their efforts
    down to specific people, but how does it help the ordinary user or data provider?
    <br><br>If your perspective is oriented from the data provider&#39;s view, those
    people that put up web sites and maintain them, they aren&#39;t really interested
    in spending huge parts of their lives adding meta-data to everything if it isn&#39;t
    going to buy them something "real". It&#39;s even worse now with people shifting
    away from free stuff, than it was when Tim first started pushing these ideas.
    Ultimately people need some type of payback for their efforts, altruistic motives
    alone don&#39;t last long enough.<br><br>Another point is that computers aren&#39;t
    intelligent, thus any sort of virtual assistant is only as smart as the logic
    that was coded into it by the programmers. That type of logic, generally rigid
    doesn&#39;t get very far before people become frustrated with how un-intelligent
    it really is. Tools shouldn&#39;t try to act intelligently, they should try to
    do bigger things with less effort. In a real sense, we should leave the "intelligence"
    to the user, while trying to give them more powerful to make acting on their desires
    as nearly trivial as possible. I don&#39;t want a virtual assistant, I want an
    interface to easily pull up my conversation history "correctly" (all of it, and
    nothing from anyone else). <br><br>Paul.

  content: 'First, thanks for taking the time to leave a well thought out description
    of your take on this. Much appreciate the feedback even if I don&#39;t see eye
    to eye on this topic.<br><br>I certainly wouldn&#39;t want to be required to tag
    everything I did so I understand your view. The semantic meta-tagging of data
    should be primarily done by automated systems with an authority system and aided
    through voluntary learning. <br><br>The intelligence I&#39;m referring to is searching
    for information relevant to me (so it could easily be characterized by rigid logic).
    <br><br>But if you don&#39;t believe in machine intelligence in search than I&#39;d
    argue take a look at Google. The tool can discover errors in spelling, and correlation
    of words to narrow down information fairly quickly. The authority system in place
    allows for massive rejection of clutter (keyword spam, link spam, etc).<br><br>The
    intelligence I hope for in semantic data is for the tags I don&#39;t know as a
    user. The machine (software on a computer) knows article A and B are related by
    a few meta data tags. It can "discover" them in near real time while I&#39;m sleeping
    and present findings to me when I have free time.<br><br>Spelling isn&#39;t proof
    of intelligence but it&#39;s a great example of partial matching in action, the
    machine has a library of words (has knowledge of them). It is capable of correct
    spelling even though a decision making individual like myself is wrong. <br><br>Chess
    programs that cost $40 can easily decimate any simple tactics I can muster by
    not only using look ahead, but by knowing (memory) the value of tactical positions.
    <br><br>The Intelligence I think you are doubtful of is the ability to reason
    or make analogies. I agree that machine intelligence in this area is still sometime
    off. <br><br>Consider the simple sentence: "Ice and snow are cold to the touch"<br><br>This
    returns from Zemanta&#39;s semantic extraction algorithm with the following tags:<br>Snow,
    Vineyard, Mendoza,Valle de Uco, Winter, School Time, Kids and Teens, The Earth<br><br>While
    there are bogus correlations, even Mendoza, Valle de Uco and Vineyard are somewhat
    related,<a href="http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=729418&page=6"
    rel="nofollow">see this picture that came up while Googlin Valle de Uco</a>. <br><br>Humans
    learn from humans, why can&#39;t complicated correlative software learn from humans?'

  content: I&#39;ve been watching the information roll by and waiting on bits and
    pieces of the semantic web to fall in place for a couple of years now. I think
    I have a handle on the processes that will be involved, and have a good idea of
    what should be expected from the web of things, cyber-agents, and all and sundry
    entailed in the dream of the semantic web.<br><br>I have looked at specifications
    and jargon riddled documents regarding the mechanics, the coding, involved in
    creating ontologies and even a little bit of the works of how the tags and meaning
    will be handled. I think I fairly understand what goes into and what comes out
    of a database as a low level, already organised, information processing unit.<br><br>What
    I have thus far failed to grasp is how will it help me with the things I want
    to do, with what I want to make smarter. I have three blogs, two annotated link
    sites (I post a link and my notes/impressions about the topic), and then I have
    copious sets of notes on myriad topics. I want to be able to leverage this knowledge.
    I want it to work for me so that I pick a topic and I have it all at my fingertips.<br><br>To
    that end I have been tagging everything manually, making connections between topics
    and ideas, and generally spending a lot of time putting together an index that
    can answer questions I&#39;ve already asked, perhaps figuratively direct future
    questions, and generally be of help or interest to me in generating new content
    built upon what I already have, and to be of help to the people who read my sites.<br><br>The
    blog tagging is nearing completion (for most of my archives) and the difficult
    part is making the connections between tags that are related but not visibly so.
    For example marketing and stock markets seem similar but are not too similar.
    Looking for something about art might send you looking at tags for painting, sculpting,
    and photography. Then there are the less obvious connections like process or method,
    and approach as tags.<br><br>This is all with a small subset of data, never mind
    what it will take to expand out elsewhere and forward in time as more information
    is published. Admittedly, my disconnect in understanding may be because I do not
    grasp enough of the concept. Having researched and watched the progress of semantic
    web blogs, articles, discussion videos, analysis that people are doing and expecting
    to do in this space I am uncertain if anyone has the answers I seek yet.<br><br>So,
    I guess I do not know if it can happen to an important enough level of sophistication,
    least of all working outside of rigid and extensive pre-programmed connections
    and tonnes of human-done work in the background.

  content: Robert your needs are precisely the type of problem space the semantic
    web promises to aid. What you require is data information aggregation and connection.
    But through your creative process you&#39;ve generated much content and the tags
    associated with that content aren&#39;t always clear. <br><br>How would a systematic
    and automated tag assignment function potentially help you create a better knowledge
    database out of your content? This is the type of tool I&#39;m currently using
    with Zemanta&#39;s API. There are spurious tags, but the automation of tagging
    allows connectivity of previously disparate data. There is also a weight associated
    with how often themes recur in your work. My hypothesis is that the tags and weights
    help position your knowledge within a larger cluster of web information. Now we
    can begin seeking connections between your blog tags, weights and others who share
    your interests and passions in their expressed ideas.<br><br>The state of modern
    semantic tools can be used as a form of knowledge and information. Not just factual
    or opinionated work but fiction and fantasy as well as I recall you have great
    interest in dark horror writing. I forsee human voting mechanisms in helping to
    improve the connectivity introduced from automated extraction algorithms. The
    definitions or authority functions used are limited.<br><br>Fantastic comment.
    I feel obligated to research the matter further and try and discover how a semantic
    web may best support Internet content generators. Do you have any related posts
    on the subject, I&#39;d be happy to link to them?

  content: If we saw eye to eye, then it wouldn&#39;t be an interesting discussion
    :-)<br><br>Google search and spelling are both great examples. In both cases a
    computer can find some issues with the data, but ultimately it takes a person
    to validate it, and often they have to ignore the incorrect associations. So a
    pattern matching tool can go out there and say that 200 lines match pattern X,
    but if you&#39;re only looking for a rather hazy subset of that, say 20 things,
    it&#39;s a problem. It is not that the computer found the correct 20 lines that
    is important, it&#39;s that it embedded them along with the incorrect 180 that
    matters. And more importantly that it cannot distinguish between the good and
    the bad.<br><br>Thus, the computer highlights all of my spelling mistakes, but
    I still need to approve each and every one (and often the computer is wrong about
    my intent). There is no intelligence in spelling, it is a straight-forward (although
    complex) algorithm whose results are calculated then put forward for an intelligent
    being to validate. <br><br>To answer your final question, I&#39;m not really sure
    whether or not AI can exist (according to some like Roger Penrose, it can&#39;t
    happen, but I&#39;ve never liked those explanations). But I am sure that right
    now, with our current state of technology, that the only way intelligent gets
    into code is by a programmer spending lots and lots of time to put it there. Ultimately,
    before the code ever gets interesting enough to do something cool, the overall
    complexity exceeds the programmer&#39;s abilities and the whole thing ceases to
    work as expected. We are still working with code at such a low level that it restricts
    what we can do with it.<br><br>For software to learn from humans, it would have
    to have some dynamic capabilities that allow it to add in information outside
    of its original programming. It&#39;s as if the code would have to have the ability
    to rewrite itself to automatically add in more and more previously unknown data-structures.
    People have done this with code, in very limited ways, but even then, the overall
    dynamism was entirely restricted by how much the programmers themselves entered
    into the code. Until you can write an accounting program that will eventually
    rewrite itself to be an editor or a video game, then the code itself is still
    too limited to actually learn anything. Of course, once you have one program that
    can do this, you have all of them :-)

  content: Now you&#39;re getting to the really fascinating stuff, programs that edit
    their own source code to "understand" new data structures. I get a little wide
    eyed when conversations go towards AI. <br><br>I&#39;m drinking the cool aid right
    now and going out on a limb by believing that software like this is even feasible.
    It would first have to understand how data is described before it could update
    it&#39;s ability to use the new data. But that&#39;s part of the promise of a
    semantic web, that information will be machine readable and associable.<br><br>Your
    comments have added a great deal of value to my post, and I&#39;m very grateful
    for it. Thanks again for your time and interest. I&#39;ll continue to read up
    on the topic and look forward to further conversations phomer. Feel free to say

  content: 'I&#39;m glad to hear that this will be the level approached by the semantic
    web movement. A lot of the discussion is geared toward understanding names and
    locations or times, and tying them to together. The low hanging fruit, so to speak,
    of organising schedules and calendars, planning trips, and managing unified communications
    while useful, and a fine first step, should only be the beginning. Likewise having
    someone&#39;s works, whether they are an author or a scientist, compiled and annotated
    at your fingertips is also just the tip of the iceberg.<br><br>Content generation
    is a topic I have come across. There have been a couple of patents put forward
    for content generators. One at least involved a partial programming schema. There
    is a video about a Patent on "Long Tail" for automated content authorship that
    I noted at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/l2y4zv" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/l2y4zv</a>
    complete with link.<br><br>This automation project seems ambitious and quite forward-looking.
    Whether it will come to fruition in short order or not is another matter. Beyond
    the ability to generate content--or as I am looking for, simply to point out directions
    to research and tangents to become involved with--there is also the legal aspect
    depending upon the type of information required. This is about the silo issue
    where different companies and parties have their own proprietary masses of data
    and little wish to share. The web part of the semantic web eases this restriction
    partially because it looks at only freely available information. Changing the
    dynamic of data restriction and opening up the walled gardens will benefit everyone.
    We are seeing some of happen now in the social networks for example.<br><br>More

<p>There are still many who believe a semantic web is beyond our technical ability to craft. And that algorithms and definitions will never agree on identifying tags. There is validity to the argument in regards to individuals, we often have our own view of the meaning of words and concepts. But the advantage of web based learning algorithms is a common set of definitions. In this case many semantic processing teams are using wikipedia as an authority for a fair set of definitions. If wikipedia links to a site it's considered relevant to the page topic. While this can be gamed temporarily by malicious editors, overall the system has proven to be highly effective at sharing information.</p>
<p>I have a great interest in this area for a couple of reasons. First and foremost I think this is the beginning of more intelligent software. Second it feeds into a project I started working on about a month ago that will match tags derived from social commentary to other converstions happening in real time as well as relevant advertising. There are several businesses emerging in this market (<a href="http://www.lazyfeed.com/">Lazyfeed</a>,Â <a href="http://www.my6sense.com/website/a/MainPage">my6sense</a>, + others,Â and <a href="http://www.apml.org/">APML </a>is working on a standard).</p>
<h2>Why I make videos</h2>
<p>I'm wrapping up with a quick description of why I make these bobbly head videos while out walking.</p>
<ol>
<li>I walk a lot. Exercise gets my brain going, and I'm a big fan of <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2009/07/18/autopilot-for-our-brain-allows-multitasking-efficiency/">multitasking</a> whenever I can get away with it</li>
<li>It's a memory assistant, I can document ideas when they're fresh in my mind and as I'm reading material</li>
<li>It's a tool of introspection. I can listen for the concepts I most often refer to, for keys into my deeper interests, and then leverage that interest to get some good work done either by blogging or coding</li>

<h4>Introducing Snap Shots from Snap.com</h4>
<p>I just installed a nice little tool on this site called Snap Shots that enhances links with visual previews of the <a class="snap_shots" href="http://www.snap.com">destination site</a>, interactive excerpts of <a class="snap_shots" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picasso">Wikipedia articles</a>, <a class="Snap_Shot_Profile" href="http://www.myspace.com/askaninja">MySpace profiles</a>, <a class="snap_shots" href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0424060">IMDb profiles</a> and <a class="snap_shots" href="http://www.amazon.com/Nokia-N95-Silver-Phone-Unlocked/dp/B000PEOLAG/">Amazon products</a>, display inline <a class="snap_shots" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=7rEM_dN24S0">videos</a>, <a class="Snap_Shot_RSS" href="http://www.slashdot.org/">RSS</a>, <a class="snap_shots" href="http://wiredset.com/media/colin_macintyre/How-Bout-I-Love-You-More.mp3">MP3s</a>, <a class="snap_shots" href="http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o34/perspexspaceship/">photos</a>, <a class="snap_shots" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=aapl">stock charts</a> and <a class="snap_shots" href="http://shots.snap.com">more</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes Snap Shots bring you the information you need, without your having to leave the site, while other times it lets you "look ahead," before deciding if you want to follow a link or not.</p>
