    :D, just in a goofy mood.
    Some days I feel like the Wizard of Oz, rough crowd he had to put up with.

<h2>Things I've never heard, but wish I did</h2>
<ul>
<li>She left you for a guy with cleaner code</li>
<li>Remember all those those Emergency Broadcasting tones with stripes on TV? They weren't tests</li>
<li>They changed their name from the Care Bears to the Hells Angels to stop other bikers from attacking them</li>
<li>A tinfoil covered kook carrying a scarecrow, a Furry, and a deranged Kansas woman dressed like a little girl laughed at him. The Wizard of Oz needs to work on his pitch if he wants to get funded. </li>
<li>That abstraction saved the company, here's a private island for your trouble</li>
<li>Don't worry about that convoluted monte carlo sim you wrote ten years ago. The new guy will modify it to monitor all life on Earth by tomorrow</li>
<li>Budget? What the fuck is a budget?</li>
<li>I'm excessively rich, eccentric, and ready to invest. Shall we take my zebra fish submarine to Rio to discuss terms?</li>
<li>Those first few decades were only a test, you failed in bizarre fashion but we decided to keep you. Why? Because it's so god damned funny watching you freak out</li>
<li>You're the King of France! <I>followed by</I></li>
<li>There's no such thing as France*</li>
<li>No really, the most interesting person in the world is You! I'll go tell Oprah.</li>
<li>Blondes make the best Buddhists</li>
<li>We're all jedi. We were just being polite until you figured it out. And no, I don't want to sleep with you, that beer will be 5 bucks, and those are the droids I'm looking for</li>
<li>The folks that run the Stock Market have decided to stop</li>
<li>We made up religion, government and money just to fuck with you, here's some pecan pie. Look on the bright side, at least porn is real.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:<br />
*= I've got nothing against France, it's just something I'd like to hear</p>
