  content: Mark, racquetball is fun. Love the metaphor. :)<br><br>And on the top of
    your post, the picture is intersecting with the Ars Vox RSS feed box because of
    your new design I suppose. You should check it out. <br><br>About your article,
    after reading it I had the thought cross my mind that the really difficult thing
    about the waves that pass through our lives is correctly harnessing them. Our
    awareness of the waves moving around us (facebook privacy backlash, iPhone next-gen
    leak scandal, anti-republican sentiment due to filibuster, etc..) can help us
    to plot our immediate business and life trajectories.... <br><br>but only if we
    are *prepared* to ride the wave<br><br>My example - the dysporia team, they were
    already prepared and hawking their concept of an open social network before the
    big *wave* of negative Facebook backlash due to privacy concerns hit. Whether
    by luck or by preparation, they were able to harness the wave.<br><br>Thus, I
    think the most important thing we can do to improve our positioning in our personal
    and business lives is to learn how, through personal inflection combined with
    up-to-date information, sense waves with as much preparation time as possible.
    I am already preparing myself for the huge wave known as the "singularity" (<a

    rel="nofollow">http://www.memebox.com/futureblogger/show/1231-...</a>) as anyone
    who has worked with AI systems knows, this is entirely or partially possible.<br><br>I
    think the next step for your article, Mark, would be what sort of concrete steps
    and resources we can undertake in order to improve our ability to sense waves
    of public sentiment before they happen, how to harness them when they do happen,
    and how to propel yourself for a long time based on that wave, instead of crashing
    into the beach. Perhaps a multi-post mini-series for your blog? I&#39;m sure many
    people would be interested in getting concrete information, resources and steps
    that they can immediately act upon!<br><br>I would like to suggest, that for sensing
    imminent waves (time span of between 1 to 3 days), hooking up to major real-time
    blog RSS streams via a RSS reader and keeping up-to-date with current information
    is useful. Real-time information is no substitute for personal inflection and
    idea formulation, but it is an important and necessary piece of the inflection
    process. Inflection is only as good as the information it is based on. :)<br><br>Hope
    I didn&#39;t ramble too much Mark. ^_^

  content: Rambling, not at all Leland. I like the mini series idea, I&#39;ll have
    to  <br>look carefully for examples in my own life where I&#39;ve had success  <br>being
    aware of, and riding the opportunity wave.<br><br>I hurried the theme swap too
    fast, will revisit the formatting asap

<p>Is the most important part of a wave the beginning, the end, or somewhere in the middle? It's a loaded question, because the answer is localized to both the amplitude of a wave as it passes through local networks, and our personal reactions to it's form or pattern as it moves past us. Information waves in the social web are spawned from events, ideas, and emotional reactions. Relationships built over time are the pathways along which waves can grow and spread. </p>
<p>Throughout our web wanderings we reinforce specific patterns which resonate with our internal image of a better world by sharing it with friends, or buying in. We lash out against messages that are the antithesis of our personal ideal, and ignore ripples that fail to register on our internal morale or philosophic compasses. We react because we believe it matters, we understand that our added attention, our vote of approval, at just the right time can push an idea far beyond the abstract initial wave form. The keepers entrusted with crafting and nurturing the wave are tasked with overcoming the often long and painful chasm to becoming real (<a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/05/from-hopes-and-dreams-to-the-real-thing.html">Fred expresses the essence of this idea well</a>).</p>
<h2>Perfecting Our Timing</h2>
<p>The first analogy which comes to mind is the many hours I spent running back and forth in a big white box, luckily the walls weren't padded (lucky until we ran into them). Timing in racquetball came from practice and refining our prediction of where the ball would be as fast as possible. The more hits, bounces and trajectories I recognized, the faster my reactions became. The rhythm of my positioning and timing of my swings became fluid after a hundred or so hours. When I wasn't such a fat guy, I was of midling skill (singles more so than doubles). For others like myself seeking to breathe life into a viral pattern, we must quickly learn the trajectory and waves of public sentiment and market opportunity in order to optimize our startup's chance of success.       </p>
<p><i>Today's riff brought to you care of <a HREF="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2010/05/13/profiting-from-anti-facebook-sentiment/#comment-50257229">Leland's comment</a> on yesterday's post. My favorite segment of his sentiment:</p>
<blockquote><p>
"The only sure way to avoid a reliance on timing and luck in a new product is simply to work your ass off and create something that has genuine value and utility in some aspect of our lives.".
</p></blockquote>
<p>In fact yesterday's post elicited marvelous feedback all around from <a HREF="http://steamcatapult.com/">Dave Pinsen</a>, <a href="http://www.arnoldwaldstein.com">Arnold Waldstein</a>, <a href="http://theinnovationist.com/">James Fuller</a>, & <a HREF="http://www.techyell.com/">Mark Nielsen</a> whom I've shared comment space with before on Robert Scoble's and Louis Gray's virtual soap boxes and social shares. Appreciate the support and wisdom gents.</I></p>
