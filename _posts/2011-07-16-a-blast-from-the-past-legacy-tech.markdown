  content: "There are so many different ways to log history that one begins to recognize
    the ways history has been logged.  If I were to choose a clip that typified technology
    it would be the opening scene from 2001 Space Odyessy\n\n<b>Odyssey - Opening
    Scene</b>\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML1OZCHixR0\n\nThen it would be Philips
    Glass's music in Koyaanisqatsi\n\n<b>Koyaanisqatsi Clip</b> \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFBijDU8PpE\n\nFrom
    here I make a hyper jump to Fred Terman :\n\n<b>Fred Terman</b>\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daaliXLBsL4\n\nThen
    inject the layer of human drama to the prior genius of innovative founding fathers/people
    :\n\n<b>Pirates of Silicon Valley</b>\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEyrivrjAuU\n\nWarp
    speed back into the present moment :\n\n<b>Evolution of Technology and the Human
    Race</b>\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcSzqm5Whwc\n\nand then jump back into
    the present moment and appreciate the perspective of another being :\n\n<b>Mark
    Essel Post July 2011</b>\nhttp://www.victusspiritus.com/2011/07/16/a-blast-from-the-past-legacy-tech/\n\nAll
    of that shows me that history is the social value stream that each of us can draw
    out.  There are far too many streams of history to pull together as one all-telling
    whole - we can appreciate history because history is but one form of technology
    available to us - the fact that digital bits and atomic bits become even more
    accessible in our age, does not mean that technology is a recent phenomena - a
    part of our biological being functions not to disimiliar to a computer.  Indeed
    the intersect between the animal and the virtual, between the social and the personal,
    is a middle point called our humanity.\n\nHistory therefore is as much a technological
    process as it is a creative process.  Without technology history only exists in
    our own minds, which thankfully means that modern life is free from the burden
    of philosophical giants who took the onus of doing thinking for society.  The
    real advancement of technology is thinking.  Here I offer another historical axis
    point called the 95 Theses of the Cluetrain Manifesto\n\n<b>Cluetrain Manifesto
    Intro</b>\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9DbmF7_TOo\n\nNotice how the writers
    of Cluetrain Manifesto used a historical context to create their social value
    stream.  Ultimately history is more than a social value stream, it is (especially
    in our age) an opportunity to understand not just how things came to be but how
    specific that being is to our own given lives.  History is only limited by our
    imagination, our desire for diversity, our capacity for integration and our capability
    dimension - i.e. that dimension which resonates with us and from there on, the
    act of ancient storytelling and future beginnings.\n\nToday therefore we have
    even more freedom to shape the macro as well as the micro aspect of history but
    we also have a greater responsibility to learn from history and not to repeat
    history where we have become more aware and to respect history because it is the
    link to our ancestors and therefore the timeline of humanity, which connects us
    all.   The DNA of history is IMHO how we curate it personally and here I see that
    we gain the capacity for both renaissance and respect.\n\nM."

    Thanks so much for the videos Emeri Gent, a wonderful gift to receive on this Sunday afternoon.

    As self aware beings, I wonder if history will ever become too much to handle. Even now with such brief lifetimes it feels like we can spend all our waking moments reviewing knowledge and lessons learned from the past. The depth of history could become a limiting factor on human cognitive development without an advanced genetic memory.

  content: "I thought about whether history will ever become too much too handle,
    and the conclusion that I reached was that the bastard child of history is mythology. 
    History produces myth because it is channeled through the lens of culture.  We
    require myth because as human beings we are natural storytellers.  What would
    baseball be without history, but can our lives become filled with too much baseball
    facts?  That is when we know it is too much.\n\nAt the same time the child prodigy
    of history is wisdom.  History is like food, we can't eat it all, but its most
    nutritious morsel is the wisdom to relate.  So history can be a recipe for disaster
    when we fail to learn from it, and a recipe for success when it opens up our eyes
    to both diversity and commonalities of the human spirit.  \n\nHow do we become
    wise?  We are wise when we can strip away history to its essence, that is to shed
    memory because memory can be false, and to embrace the jewel or gold nuggets from
    the ore of history.  We don't need advanced genetic memory for that, we just need
    to develop a sense of wonder complimented with a deep sense of humility that we
    are not built to know it all.  Ultimately where I think wisdom takes us is to
    enjoy what is in the supporting context of what was.\n\n<b>[Em]</b>"

<p>Looking down at my phone and checking for JetSki rentals on this beautiful Saturday morning, followed by browsing video shares of friends on various social networks numbs my sensitivity to just how dramatically technology is evolving. Just a few generations ago computers weren't even part of the human experience. Today digital systems permeate every aspect of our daily lives.</p>
<p>The first video I came across is a demonstration of a modem that's 10 years older than me, and astonishingly it still works. Thanks to <a href="https://plus.google.com/102307008290001893965/posts">Tyler Gillie's</a> coming across and sharing the video.</p>

<p>So much has changed in the world of tech both on the hardware side and the software that it makes possible. It's refreshing to take stock and look at the marvels we take for granted in our hyper connected information age, and compare them to their humble beginnings. </p>
