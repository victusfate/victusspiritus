<h1>Mother's Day Shopping 101</h1>
<p>Yesterday I celebrated mothers day with friends and family, along with much of the rest of the US. A day earlier I sat on a bench between the Apple Store and Barnes and Nobles after an epic Cobb salad from CPK (it should be for $13.49.) One tablet would be the winner of my hard fought dollars, but beyond the weighing of cost and features the forcing function of time drove a decision. </p>
<p>The last minute shopping choice was a color Nook ereader for my mom. The Nook has a great range of features at a reasonable price. Tablets are my preferred living room lounge browser, and that is precisely how my mom uses her laptop to interact with her doll collector and knitting net communities.</p>
<p>After sitting down with her at my Grandmother's adult home, and at dinner afterwards I believe the iPad would be a better fit to her needs. The larger screen and faster and friendlier user interface were critical features to my mom's intended usage. In addition the Nook comes with a limited Barnes and Nobles only Android store unless it's rooted, making the iOS AppStore a clear winner. The iPad has a snappier UI, and responsiveness matters as it saves wasted gestures and frustrated misclicks.</p>
<p>The only limitation is that typing into a Tablet sucks. I think she'll always be more comfortable using a keyboard for social web activity much as I prefer keyboards and HUGE BEAUTIFUL displays and windowing environments for development (I've grown accustomed to blogging and commenting via the iPhone). Fortunately I've seen a great variety of blue tooth keyboard/tablet combos, often all in one case, which provides the choice of easy input or hand held browsing.</p>
