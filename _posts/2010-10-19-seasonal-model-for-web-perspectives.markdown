  content: Need to be cautious about inadvertently or surreptitiously establishing
    a mutual self-admiration society yet I find that every one of your posts that
    I have read thus far do resonate with me in many ways such that I feel oft compelled
    to click "Like" just because I do "Like" and feel your insight and musings well
    worth sharing with as many others as possible.

  content: There's no harm in declaring sentiment. Agree that if all we do is upvote/like,
    then the signal meaning becomes watered down. It's another form of communication,
    and can serve well when a comment doesn't come to mind.

<p><I>Winter: Technical Execution</I></p>
<p>Hacker minds dwell on clarity of code form, models, and data interfaces. A resolute hacker's mind is like cold steel. They ignore all else, even their own environment as time bends around them</p>
<p><I>Spring: Ease of Use, Verdant Growth</I></p>
<p>Designer minds explore elegance, form, and above all user interfaces. Never satisfied with a malformed div, a shallow gradient or unnecessary cruft, the designer is the waking dreamer</p>
<p><I>Summer: Serendipitous Seeker</I></p>
<p>Casual browser minds revolve around social connectivity, entertainment, and discovery. Time vanishes as links are traversed and content rabidly consumed. Their only motivation, to drink deeply of the finest free information in whatever form it manifests. Like blades of growing grass each browser has unique and changing criteria for relevance</p>
<p><I>Fall: Task Driven Search</I></p>
<p>Client minds focus on a problem they're working to solve, everything else is noise. Time is their constant enemy, a wall that drives them forward, the harbinger of judgement</p>
<p><I>Which season do you most relate to?</I></p>
<p>Most of us have affinity to certain perspectives over others, but no season exists in absence of the others. At a given time we see through a blend of these views. No doubt a few disciplined masters excel by quieting competing voices and focusing on a single mode.</p>
<p>While working with web applications, we can all benefit by taking a few moments to understand the needs and outlooks of each perspective. It's even more important to recognize clearly which view mode(s) will be most dominant for the audience you are serving.</p>
