<p>I rely on Chromium to aid in my web development, and have done so for the past couple of years. Inspect element has a <em>firebug built</em> in effect which is hard to beat, although I haven't done much with the console. Even though I've poked around with this for a while now, I picked up some great tricks from Paul's video. If you do any web development you'll enjoy it.</p>
<p>Thanks to Paul Kinlan for the heads up<br />

<p>ps: I caught the video in my tweet stream at the end of February and reshared it, but only tuned in to watch it this morning thanks to <a href="http://knowabout.it">knowabout.it's</a> video feature. Log in to their site, then select videos on the collection to see all the videos in your social stream.</p>
