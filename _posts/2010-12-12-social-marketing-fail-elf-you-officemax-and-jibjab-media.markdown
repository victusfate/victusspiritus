    It's probably in their terms of service that they can email any email you give them. While annoying, I can understand why companies would do this.

    I just think there are easier ways for companies to reach out to companies on sites like Facebook with http://facebook.getmorepopular.com for example. Between that and Google ads and blogging and other methods, there are easier ways to reach out to customers.

    They had great potential for the lead in with a simple deal and request for more information/subscribing. Instead Officemax and JibJab chose to autosubscribe all email recipients to their mailing lists with additional personal info to get off the list.

    Totally agree that there are better methods to reach potential customers.

<p>Yesterday my wife put together a silly elf video with faces of our family members which you can watch if you're morbidly curious, I rel="nofollow"ed the image above. She then shared the video by email with a few of us (oh no). As you can imagine in the video we're all quite skilled dancers yet require extra small sizes. So far so good, thanks for a goofy video with a built in ad for the host of the service. Here's the first email:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/first_email.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6229" title="first_email" src="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/first_email.png" alt="" width="463" height="316" /></a><br />
At this point I'm confident most savvy browsers will sense trouble coming. An email address has been passed to agencies for which emails are treated as currency (both OfficeMax and JibJab Media).</p>
<p><em>The spam begins</em></p>
<p>I received a followup email with an in-store $10 discount off of purchases $30 or more without ever asking.<br />
<a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/spam.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6225" title="spam" src="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/spam.png" alt="" width="500" height="700" /></a><br />
At the bottom of the message I rapidly scanned for the unsubscribe link to get the hell off their spam list fast. These lists have a tendency to grow and spread to other sources unchecked. To my surprise I couldn't unsubscribe without first giving more information to a service to which I never subscribed:<br />

This is where poor marketing decisions were made by both OfficeMax and JibJab Media. Not only did I <strong>NOT</strong> give them permission to email me a single offer, I never signed up for a recurring subscription of spam.  I can imagine the devil's advocates out there thinking, "Oh but your wife sharing the video means you DID sign up".  I have to reject this line of thinking. I never signaled OfficeMax or JibJab that I wished to subscribe and by not allowing me to unsubscribe without giving them more information they've identified themselves as shady spammers that will never get my business.</p>
<p>As an aside, I publicly share my email address on <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/about/">my blog</a> and my <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/resume/marks_resume.html">html5 web resume</a> and have never had any issues with unsolicited advertising. Happy holidays everyone, but please don't elf yourself or your friends and family by signing them up for spam.</p>
