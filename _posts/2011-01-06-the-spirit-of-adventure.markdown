<p>One of the words our dogs frenzy over is <i>adventure</i>. They translate the sound into running around and playing in the (big) backyard. <i>Adventure</i> is second only to <strong>bacon</strong> when it comes to instigating the critters to action. I have little doubt that the spirit of the word is etched into the strands of their DNA. But what does the word mean to us?</p>
<p>For some adventure is anything out of the ordinary. For others it's a two week cruise to a tropical locale. A few souls will call adventure two years backpacking around the world, and fewer still will climb the peak of Everest or travel across Antarctica. Adventure has varied degrees of meaning for each of us.</p>
<p>To those struck by wanderlust, may you find adventure in each and every day.</p>
