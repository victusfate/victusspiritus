  content: I have had a yahoo email address for years that I use regularly for occasions
    when I'm unsure how a company or person is going to use my email address.  I check
    it regularly but nothing of importance goes in there.

    Damn them!

    I will have to pay attention, we have a few Simons Malls out here as well. I usually don't go to them, but when I do I will be sure to protect my gmail!

    The morning fog prevented their timely application.

  content: "Mark this topic is too good to resist for me to merely sit on the sidelines
    :-)  \n\nThere are three things I can say about spammers - that first it is their
    day job, second think of the song and third spam as tweets.\n\n<b>First,let us
    think of spam as \"their day job\"...</b>\nSeems obvious to me, that the reason
    you may have overlooked the check box (put it simply) maybe a Freudian slip. 
    It is either that because spammers must still have a life after they have finished
    cashing their pennies of spam, that when they want to retire for the evening to
    an intelligent places, it probably would be a place somewhere, such as your blog. 
    We can at least grant them that benefit, even if they don't really benefit any
    of us.  That however is purely a psychic explanation :-)\n\n<b>Second, remember
    that spam is also a classic song&gt;</b>\nMonty Python's song reminds us that
    spam has always accompanied the very stuff we dig into.  Next time you see a whole
    wad of spam, think of this particular sketch below - for it might take the edge
    off something that otherwise is a daily nuisance. IMHO it is always good to reframe
    things into something completely different.  Of course, Monty Python were the
    supreme experts in \"and now for something completely different\" ... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8huXkSaL7o
    \n\n<b>Third, another reframe is spam as tweets, or even poetry...</b>\nWe all
    know what spam is and we should go to greater lengths to try to see less of it,
    but whatever we do get to see, can also be transformed into objects that we take
    for granted but which we don't think of spam.  Spam can be, for instance, be considered
    as really awful tweets. Spam can also be considered, in another way, as the worst
    kind of Vogon poetry http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxPeIiU2kx4\n\n<b>Conclusion</b>\nOf
    course, there is always my tweets, the latest set which accompanies you-tube video's
    that are usually laced with advertisements...  \n\nNickelback \"If Today Was Your
    Last Day\"\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe-Eosmk6oE\nFantasy is the soapy suds,
    pragmatism is the water to wash it all off.\n\nPhil Collins \"Another Day in Paradise\"\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2n_hXsX4mo\nWork
    colleagues wish for Friday while I bless the very breath I take...\n\nNeil Diamond
    \"I am...I Said\"\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxDyXK93o6g\nIdentity isn't
    a rating, it is a price, which we either sell or we get sold for.\n\nLinkin Park
    \"Somewhere I Belong\"\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iCtpuQvydk\nBelonging
    is that somewhere I have placed myself between the womb &amp; the tomb.\n\nUltimately,
    I personally think in more immediate terms, for if the spammers led to either
    a brief or even longer term return to the Victus Spiritus by the one they call
    \"Mark Essel\", then all I can say, is bless them ol'spammers, oh, bless em' indeed

<p>It was early in the morning as I walked the perimeter of the mall to avoid the remnants of the tropical storm that rolled through the north east this week. As usual I connected to the free WiFi graciously provided by Simons Mall, but there was one subtle difference. The log in screen had changed requesting my name and email address or cell phone number. Not quite awake I entered my actual email address and connected, completely unaware that I had just unleashed Lovecraftian horrors out of Pandora's Box. </p>
<p>The spam emails began rolling in yesterday afternoon and continued into this morning. I suspect the spam will only grow over the next few weeks making my gmail account completely unusable as an information conduit. It turns out there's a small box that is checked by default just off the bottom of the mobile web WiFi sign up page that says "yes please spam me with bull shit offers for the rest of my life". I never saw the checked box, and I foolishly entered my true email address. Thank you Simons Mall for killing my gmail account.</p>
<p>For comparison I should share that my email address is on public web pages in several locations, and yet I've never received anything resembling the deluge of junk email as I have over the past 24 hours. Black hat advertising is malicious, irrelevant, and disgusting.</p>
<p>Don't make the same mistake I did. Don't ever, EVER enter your email address into any web form unless you absolutely trust the company not to sell off your information for a few cents.</p>
<p><strong>update</strong><br />
The spam mails have subsided, perhaps Google has identified the bulk of them and kindly forwarded them to /dev/null on my behalf.</p>
