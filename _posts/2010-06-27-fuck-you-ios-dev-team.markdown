  content: Something similar happened to me.  I spent hours trying to recover the
    backup of notes using SQLite utilities.  Good thing I was a computer design engineer.

    NO ONE knows why or can explain it - not the internet nor the geniuses at the
    bar.  I didn&#39;t know syncing was such rocket science.

  content: Thanks a landlord it! I acquired yet some insight. Life is so colorful,
    we should be able to live in, such as Korea and honor the planet. Human life is
    like rivers, slowly flowing, flowing rivers, flowing through the snow, flows through
    the prairie and ultimately into the sea, return to the embrace of nature, start
    a new reincarnation. Allow us to feel the meaning of life will come only to those
    you have those memories  http://www.cheap-nikeshox.com

  content: It gets better. I buy all Apple pcs now. Completely hooked on their interfaces
    and developer tools. This kinda cognitive dissonance is not right. But it's the
    Faustian deal I made. No best choice comes regret free.

    ANYONE THAT BUILD AN UPGRADE KNOW ALL CHANGES PISS SOMEONE OFF. IT NOT SPECIAL APPLE PROBLEM. CHANGE COLOR OF BUTTON, AND SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE, INSIST ENTIRE LIFE RUINED.

    AS LONG AS TOTAL VALUE OF SYSTEM AND UPGRADES OUTWEIGH TEMPORARY PROBLEM CAUSED BY CHANGES, IT STILL NET POSITIVE.

    Yeah I think so, because it looked like a door when I walked through it.
    I figured out how to unhook it again from auto (faulty) synchronization so it's back to a door again.

<p>*update I rewrote <a href="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2010/06/27/analogy-and-machine-intelligence/">the post</a>*<br />
My apologies for the rant without proper explanation. I should disclose since writing this post I've converted over our home network to Macs, and I have great respect for the design of the OS/hardware. This subtle change in the notepad app on iOS really caught me off guard.</p>
<h2>iOS 4 now attempts to sync notes wiping them out</h2>
<p>After spending an hour and a half writing up a post on analogies, machine intelligence and popular web apps that perform aspects of reasoning (abduction & <a HREF="http://www.hunch.com">Hunch*</a>) the latest iPhone OS or iOS decided synchronizing notes would be nice and deleted 90% of the post. This is a new "feature" and invalidates my writing strategy of caching a local copy of a post before sending it to Wordpress to avoid data loss.</p>
<p>It's vexing losing time spent writing due to failed design, it's extraordinarily frustrating to lose hours of work because of short sighted feature upgrades. </p>
<p>notes:<br />
*= I commend the team at (founders Caterina Fake and Chris Dixon) Hunch and similar knowledge systems for pushing machine intelligence forward through consumer applications. It's a creative and brilliant way to fuel research.</p>
