<h2>other times you may be the master</h2>

<p><I>the pawn</I></p>
<p>The role of the pawn is a powerless state pursued by masochists. Its ranks are filled by unfortunate souls who fall prey to manipulation and unrelenting students who seek greater skill.</p>
<p><i>The player</I></p>
<p>The player is differentiated from the pawn by knowledge, skill, and power, for they are wise fools. A player understands their environment and is often driven by a desperate plight to overcome an entrenched adversary, be it man or nature.</p>
<p><I>The Master</I></p>
<p>The master rarely encounters opposition outside of their own asymptotic path to perfection. They are not only supremely adept, but in order to become so they have achieved immeasurable self discipline or found harmony in chaos. Their execution is flawless, their style is legendary, yet they aren't omnipresent. </p>
<p>The question of when and where to act takes on dire significance to a master and those they encounter. Reality is reshaped in the wake of their path. Like butterfly wings, the master's effortless action irresistibly ripples the fabric of existence far removed in both space and time.</p>
