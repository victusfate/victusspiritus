<p><i>Ego is Insufficient</I></p>
<p>With the way media celebrates and demonizes pop company leadership, the message implied is that the CEO or founders are the core of a business. But I'm writing today because this is incorrect. A handful of energetic voices are an inadequate foundation for a lasting business. Nor is the core of a business it's technology staff or creative talent. The vital kernel of any nascent business is purpose. One mega ego or even a few large egos may be present at company formation, but without a mission to drive them forward, to bind them together, and attract new talent they will drift apart, or at best develop a transient business*. </p>
<p><i>Purpose outlasts founders, investors, and CEOs</I> </p>
<p>Market need met with corporate execution are ongoing requirements for doing business, but they aren't the corporate identity. If branding is how the world perceives a business, then purpose is how people inside view a company. Businesses survive changing leadership, losing key employees, and trading investors. Corporations die without purpose, and greed is not enough^.</p>
<p>Notes:<br />
*= Transient companies are short lived or the type of companies that are acquired and then quickly fall apart. </p>
<p>^= Unless your Goldman Sachs</p>
