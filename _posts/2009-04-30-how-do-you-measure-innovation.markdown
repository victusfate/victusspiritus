<p style="color: #c00000; font-size: 18px; font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Is innovation capped by how much funding it receives?</p>
<p style="color: #c00000; font-size: 18px; font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Or is it measured by how much money it generates?</p>
<p style="color: #c00000; font-size: 18px; font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Is it reflected in the disruption to existing industries?</p>
<p>How much of our future business and economy is reliant on the innovation of entrepreneurs?  This is a question I asked myself, instigated by the ever musing <a href="http://www.avc.com/">Fred Wilson</a> and his recent posts on <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/04/the-venture-capital-math-problem.html">The Venture Capital Math Problem</a>.  What is the upper bound on the financial payoff generated by the work and creativity of startup founders (that are fueled by VC funding)?</p>
<p>I use the word all the time but I don't really know how to nail it down or quantify it.  Innovation simply means introducing something new.  It's definition doesn't include a mention of being better, although when the term is commonly used there is an understanding of improvement with innovation.</p>
<p>If innovation is unquantifiable, why do we use it as a measure of goodness?</p>
<p>My question to you:</p>
<p>How do you measure innovation in your business and why do you do so?</p>
