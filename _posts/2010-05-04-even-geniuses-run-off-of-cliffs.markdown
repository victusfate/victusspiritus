    sign of intellectual laziness"<br><br>contrast with<br><br>"...yet has faith in

    in anything is unquestioning belief which is unfounded, and intellectually lazy.
    I&#39;m not saying that I&#39;m free of any such beliefs, but we should try to
    be, as the rest of your post suggests. I&#39;m not sure why you seem to think
    faith is a good thing (or even if you actually do think it&#39;s a good thing).
    <br><br>I guess the biggest glaring assumption that I hold is that I have free
    will. I can&#39;t demonstrate it, I can&#39;t show that it&#39;s necessarily an
    axiom, and I can&#39;t even define it. I still assume it.'

  content: 'Faith is belief without reason, either deductive, or inductive. If you
    can deduce something, then it is true, given the hypothesis. But how about the
    hypothesis? Well, those induces from hypotheses, which ultimately come from the
    sensory information we gather. How do we know we can use reason to discover the
    truth? This is taken as axiomatic, but, consider what existence would be if you
    fully rejected this axiom: you would very quickly die (rejecting your senses,
    and all your knowledge based on inductive and deductive reasoning would make you
    ignore all of the world&#39;s hazards). This of course is based on knowledge gained
    via reason. Ultimately, you may say that the reasonable man still holds the hypothesis
    that reason is the proper means of gaining knowledge, which I can accept. <br><br>You
    might call it faith in this epistemology, or you might call it adhering to our
    own nature. The important thing is that it works: it is self-consistent, it works
    to better our lives, and master nature. Great things can be accomplished, and
    understood. <br><br><br>Contrast this with the faithful man: beliefs are unfounded,
    can&#39;t be contradicted by reality (because perception of reality is rejected
    as a means of gaining knowledge), the knowledge leads to nothing, is randomly
    obtained, with wildly varying results for different men (notice how religious
    texts never seem to agree that a god from the other side of the world is the true
    god), and gives man no control over nature. It&#39;s interesting that people prop
    faith up as superior to reason, given that most of its accomplishments are horrific,
    and at best a waste of time. Sure, some people pretend that miracles occur, but
    they never have any real evidence. Making shit up doesn&#39;t really help anybody,
    including ourselves (though some might argue that making up religions and suckering
    people into giving you money is a selfish deed, I would say that a person who
    lives off of others by conning them in such a way lives a miserable existence).<br><br>Hope
    and feelings don&#39;t change reality. They can motivate you to a course of action,
    but unless that course is navigated by reason, you will surely get lost and end
    up somewhere other than your desired destination.'

    the two of you:<br><br>Today, should I say "I believe Sun rises in the east" or
    "I have faith that Sun rises in the east". <br><br>["Sun rises in the east" is
    a "rhyme" in nursery, a "visible truth" & "geography lesson" for the next few
    years, a fallacy in high-school due to the new lesson "the-sun-doesn&#39;t-rise-its-the-earth-that-revolves",
    a valid observation in university relativistic physics and finally back to being
    a daily faith/belief/truth in normal life.]

  content: I agree with pretty much your entire line of reasoning except for one question
    on this last comment of yours, "Hope and feelings don&#39;t change reality. They
    can motivate you to a course of action, but unless that course is navigated by
    reason, you will surely get lost and end up somewhere other than your desired
    destination."<br><br>Where does your desired destination come from? Where is it&#39;s
    source? Is it reason? Why do you distinguish between hope and action? Without
    motivation there cannot be life. Why do people feel a need to create, or to imagine.
    Where&#39;s the logic in that? Why do we dream? Some of these questions are difficult
    to drill down to bare rational essentials.<br><br>Compare our* state of understanding
    of the universe now compared to a hundred years ago, 500 years ago, and a few
    thousand years ago. Given our love of technology (we&#39;ll fuel it&#39;s research
    for some time), how far will our ability to manipulate ourselves and our environment
    go? We may discover truths about the universe that touch upon the foundations
    of reason, and the blurring nature of matter, energy and information. It&#39;ll
    take some wild leaps of science to get there.<br><br>note, *= the scientific accepting
    community which may be a small minority<br><br>The primitives are fun, hunger,
    need for a warm home,etc. Then belonging, human connectivity and socializing.
    But our hunger for something new, our curiosity appears to be unquenchable. The
    source for that "hunger" can be labeled rationally as an evolutionary advantage.
    We could hypothesize that incurious folks would die out over time, and there may
    even be some evidence to support that floating around. Maybe too curious people
    die out over time too.<br><br>While we are biological machines, by your admission
    you believe in free will. Yet we can&#39;t prove it, we just feel that we have
    choices. That our consciousness grants us the ability to be more than the sum
    of chemical signals and binary neural transmissions.<br><br>How do you feel about
    complex adaptive systems as a representative model? I got stuck trying to work
    out the information content of human DNA in an old post because of the growing
    nature of sequence information over generations.

    It&#39;s better that I try to elaborate precisely what I mean, as in trust, gut

    faith, but in my brain overlapped which painted a confusing picture for you.

  content: Lidicus, this is an excellent point. Are we truly capable of free will?
    The possibility exists that we are all being controlled on the base level by an
    exterior force.<br><br>And consider for a moment how our emotions are frequently
    affected by our immediate surroundings and situations. Obviously, a man in a prison
    will act different then a man living by himself on a farm. But the man himself
    is the same... simply being in a different situation causes our "free will" to
    be not so free. Hmmm, an observation such as this leads me to believe that our
    free will really is an illusion and at best we only have a partially true free
    will.

  content: I&#39;m on the same wavelength here Mark. I believe that faith is the logical
    outcome of our race&#39;s development into social animals. The base fact is that
    in order to function as a society, we MUST have faith in our fellow man to be
    truthful, dependable, etc... Indeed, our rise as the dominant species on this
    planet could not have been possible without assumption and reliance on things
    that rarely change. <br><br>In the contemporary world, we have an excess of energy.
    This excess of energy allows us to spend time and effort examining things that
    in the past were assumed to be true, because proving the validity of such things
    required much effort and energy expenditure. As we were able to provide more food
    and time for ourselves, our ability to question our faith and assumptions has
    gradually allowed us to develop our science and technology.<br><br>Thus, Mark,
    your post is 100% spot on in that questioning assumptions and faiths we assume
    to be true (because someone successful says so, or otherwise) is the path towards
    the future.<br><br>I think it is very liberating to look at things with a critical
    eye.

<p>Wiley E. Coyote, grand ACME customer &amp; self identified super genius</p>
<h2>Unquestionable Assumptions</h2>
<p><em>This short post is dedicated to my brother who questions everything, yet has faith in outlandish and wild possibilities. We're more similar than different in this regard</em></p>
<p>At the core of even complex solutions there lie principle assumptions which are never questioned. Even broaching the sanctity of the fundametal tenets is considered heresy in most established fields of science and technology.</p>
<ul>
<li>The wheel was designed assuming the surface it rolls over is mostly flat</li>
<li>The uniform measure of weight assumes that gravity is fairly regular across the surface of the planet</li>
<li>Aircraft assume a level of atmospheric smoothness capable of sustaining lift</li>
</ul>
<p>Innovation can only flourish if we both learn from and vigorously assault the rational of existing standards. I find the practice of identifying and analyzing these inherent assumptions to be an incredible source of creativity, inspiration, and learning. <em>To accept assumptions without question, indefinitely, is a hazardous sign of intellectual laziness</em> Even the fairly benign and stable criteria of jogging along the ground, will inevitably lead to running off of a cliff.</p>
<p>Today I'm requesting that each of you review just one standard that you rely on with an open mind. Critically examine the assumptions, and more importantly the limitations that the standard is founded on. You may find that they're all completely valid. Or you may discover a tiny opening, a chip in the armor, anything that doesn't quite sit well with your reasoning. What impacts and restrictions does this false assumption place on the defacto standard? What new opportunities or standards are now practical? You have the enviable task of fighting uphill to convince the world you're right.
