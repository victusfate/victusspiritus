  content: Very similar story here... same machine, same Windows time bomb, same linux
    solution, same frustration with Netflix.  I ended up calling their customer service
    and asking for Ubuntu support.  Hopefully Netflix will wake up sooner or later.

  content: Thanks for speaking up bottleman. I pulled out a good swathe of hair this
    week trying to get a smooth solution. The good news, the latest flash beta drivers
    are using the ION video card so it&#39;s not choppy anymore (YouTube, hopefully
    Hulu, etc).

  content: The part about you having to make your sound work is the exact kind of
    reason why I don&#39;t want to switch to linux. A few years back, I had to go
    deep (for me at the time) to configure my internet access to create a pppoe connection
    only to find out that not only did I need to have the pppoe connection working,
    I also needed to find (by my own hands) direct IP addresses from my ISP that could
    connect to the modem and bring me internet goodness.<br>That was a real pain !<br><br>as
    for the DRM content way,<br>providing a solutions that openly empowers content
    owner when publicly sharing is imo the way to go. A tool to make NewsCorp and
    the likes get out of their comfort zone with an understanding of a possible very
    good income of money.<br>It always striked me when p2p started to really take
    off (middle of the mininova days I would say), <br>that content provider would
    benefit from having virtually anyone able to watch what they have to offer the
    way they want to.<br>Like a movie that&#39;s out on theater, the day after available
    online through an open protocol that lets them get the income back to them would
    multiply the $$ so much !

  content: Linux has become much more user friendly in the past decade or so (since
    I last explored it), but it&#39;s still not as easy to setup/use as a Mac. <br><br>I
    totally agree a system which puts content creators in the drivers seat of their
    own destiny would flip the media companies. Sadly big investors still hold the
    keys to creativity for many.

  content: I think it depends how you sell it to them.<br>If you come at them and
    make them realize that instead of wasting money to ensure that the content doesn&#39;t
    spread, they would promote their content and get their money back 10x because
    people like to watch something a few more times for example.

<p>Recently I picked up a new living room computer (Acer Aspire Revo, named "Ouroborus") and a pretty juiced up LCD*. I decided it was time for an upgrade from the 10 year old projector tv, which hasn't been able to stream web content since the XBOX 360 red ringed (died). </p>
<p>Windows 95 (the purchased OS) had some issues. Nothing major, but I couldn't get the audio driver to enable Nvidia HDMI audio. My fianc√© had a windows trojan catastrophe a few months back so neither of us were excited about having another time bomb to constantly have to monitor, soothe, and coax into functionality. Being very satisfied with the <a HREF="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2010/01/31/cutting-ties-with-my-old-friend-microsoft/">switch to Ubuntu</a> on my desktop I decided to do the same for Ouroborus (the Revo).</p>
<p>After I setup a USB stick with the latest 64bit Ubuntu install a couple of days back, I finally got sound working on Ouroborus connected by an HDMI cable to the living room display. I snagged Boxee and sat back on the couch ready to enjoy some Netflix instant queue goodness with Michelle and my brother Ron. But to my surprise, there was no Netflix option. A few hurried searches later and it sunk in that there was and would not be for some time a "Silverlight" Netflix streaming solution on any Linux systems (without virtual windows/Mac operating systems). So I did what every content hungry shopper would do, I looked for competition!   </p>
<h2>Netflix is the only Subscription Content Streaming Game in Town</h2>
<p>I <I>was</I> a happy user of Netlix for over a year, and enjoyed the content they enabled with their streaming service. As I mentioned above, I moved away from Windows to Ubuntu flavored Linux and it tastes great, except I've noticed a couple of issues. <strong>Web Content</strong> providers aren't comfortable porting to Linux. But wait, isn't one of principles of the web enabling smooth information flow through it without concern for underlying operating systems? </p>
<p>First I bumped into iTunes problems, that's a big no go unless you trick out your WINE (I had issues) or run a windows/osx virtual machine. Then Kindle reader showed itself to be another Linux no go. So DRM streamed content isn't really "web content". It relies on specific operating systems, and I'm left wondering where to look for content (that I can pay the creator for).  I'm more than willing to pay for content I enjoy. There's something comforting and reasonable knowing that perhaps a few pennies on the dollar are going to the people that create engaging entertainment.</p>
<p>So far I've come across Amazon streaming content, and I'm pretty sure it will work over any browser (with Flash). Is there another subscription web video service that streams to any browser?</p>
<p>*new LCD:  Phillips, 47", 29000to1 contrast, 120hz meh, "<a href="http://projectlore.com/blog/april-fools-of-years-past/">has sound</a>"</p>
