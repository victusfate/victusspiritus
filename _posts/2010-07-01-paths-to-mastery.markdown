<h2>Which comes first Loving Your Job or Master Craftsmanship</h2>
<p>When I began Victus Spiritus, I was extremely confident of a path to time value mastery and job satisfaction. If we match our dearest interests and a form of labor, eventually extraordinary value is the result of that pairing. While I continue to hold this belief, another path to value became clear. Between mastery and passion for work, It may not matter which precedes the other. </p>
<p>The subject of our labor may not be more important than the <a href="{{ site.url }}/?s=relentless+will&submit=Search">conviction</a> we bear towards it's execution. Instead of having an enthusiasm for a specific type of work, some of us can find satisfaction in the process of mastering it. </p>
<p>We are more than capable of leveraging our unique style to own just about any flavor of labor*. The road to mastery is unsure, arduous, and unique. But there are a few features in common to the journey:</p>
<ul>
<li>frightening dedication to details</li>
<li>heavy sacrifice of other activities, moderation is not an option, at least not now</li>
<li>the obsessive focus necessary to push from hobbyist, through skilled pro, and finally beyond any question of mastery</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people follow a lifestyle of moderately balanced (competing) responsibilities and leisure. But nearly everyone has at least one interest which if viewed from a third party is beyond the bounds of normalcy^. Nurturing this passion into mastery is what I've written about in <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/tag/inspiration/">at least a 150 different ways</a>. The passion that inspires our greatest craftsmanship, or the craftsmanship that inspires our greatest passion are two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>Notes:<br />
*= remind me to share the brief tales of "pull out a post, eat a worm" or the "devil springs tree transfer & ivy breakdance"<br />
^= The objects of our obsession can be either healthy or destructive. Living with destructive obsessions is a topic for another post.</p>
