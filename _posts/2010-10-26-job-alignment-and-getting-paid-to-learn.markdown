  content: Good post. Absolutely the most critical skill for ANYONE in an early stage
    start-up is the ability to learn and reiterate quickly. All the skills and intellect
    in the world is useless without this ability.

  content: "I think this is the first time I've been the focus of a post!  Glad I
    gave you some inspiration Mark!\n\nOne of the best parts about startup life is
    that you are always learning and figuring out new ways to accomplish your goals.
    \ It's the main reason why I know I'll be a serial entrepreneur.  Maybe not a
    successful one, but at least I'll always be learning.  "

  content: Thanks Scott for the morning blog fuel. I forgot or wasn't aware you and
    Tyler Kieft used to work together. If success is the pay window, yeah you can't
    guarantee that no matter how smart, fast or skilled you are your current venture
    will "succeed". But I have little doubt over a longer time horizon that you'll
    find great success in both the knowledge you gain, and the folks you connect with
    and support with your tireless efforts.

    Also being able to fake it till you make it.

    I honestly suck at 'programming'. But i can hack just about anything together with enough knowledge of what im doing.

  content: "Larger organizations and enterprise level libraries/tools have an entirely
    different outlook on utility. If I get something to work, it's a minor success.
    If it works smoothly and rapidly it's a medium success. If the code is tight and
    easy to follow it's a major breakthrough.\n\nI caught up on a little objective
    c programming and I don't see it as \"another c++\" as much as I first thought.
    Couchapps still break my brain, beyond small ones. The interactions are all over.
    Hoping soca makes easing in a little friendlier. "

The above image was a short exchange between Scott Carleton of <a href="http://artsicle.com/">Artsicle</a> and Tyler Kieft of <a href="http://speakertext.com/">SpeakerText</a> starting from the bottom. It provided the impetus for the rest of this post.</p>
<p>Many companies, especially larger organizations, don't want to admit to paying their employees to learn on the job. They want them to execute at peak level and learn after hours by getting approved certifications (certs are the mind killer). In my experience that's not the way learning happens. Only when you're neck deep in a project for a number of weeks (months) all the time do you really soak it in. Throughout this period you're continually motivated to make something work well and prioritize it over all else.</p>
<p>From my web wanderings I've read thousands of posts over the past year on startups. You could say I'm fanatic about startups that primarily leverage the Internet to grow. From this activity I've identified the most compelling reason to forge or join a nascent company is that they not only encourage you to take risks and learn, they expect you to. There's a tradeoff though. The required weekly hours to kick ass in a startup are somewhere between 70 and 18x7. If you're extra work life demands you work less, an extreme startup may not be your best option. There are plenty of more casual startup positions out there, but make sure both company and your own expectations are out in the open. If things aren't working out, expect to be looking for another position quickly. Match making in startups moves fast and in a few weeks on the job you and your employers/cofounders will know if there's a fit.</p>
<p><em>Hacker Founders/Early Employees</em></p>
<p>As a technical cofounder or employee, you can expect a steep learning curve when it comes web development. I find myself getting corrected by skilled hackers on a daily basis, while digging deeper into data flow through the web.  I had no idea when I started exploring Rails late last year that I'd be spending so much time reading documentation on a slew of protocols, frameworks, and languages. If you're not hanging with the best open source hackers at the get go don't despair. Just a few years ago many of them were in your shoes. Their intimate technical knowledge and ability to communicate that understanding was hard earned (don't discount the latter skill).</p>
<p><em>Business Founders/Early Employees</em></p>
<p>You'll be learning just as fast, but with a different set of tools. Your responsibilities demand marketing acumen as you chart the startup's survival course through early customer funding or hooking outside investors. Landing outside funding from angels or VCs still appears like genie magic to me. Yet I recognize patterns in funded companies: they're lead by experienced entrepreneurs, they have proven early market traction, and they have substantial growth and revenue. Social proof is often referred to by early stage professional investors, but I'm not familiar with how first time founders earn that kind of trust.</p>
