  content: 'As you know, the US is not a direct democracy but a representative one.
     As Edmund Burke so famously stated in England in 1774, "Your representative owes
    you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving
    you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion." A representative must balance the desires
    of his constituency with that of the good of the state and nation as a whole.
     In the US we hope and strive to elect wise and just representatives to weigh
    the issues at hand and grant them enough staff to sort through the matter efficiently
    because we each have our own personal and local concerns which make it impossible
    for us to be as informed on all topics.  A direct democracy, while now seemingly
    possible using electronic means, could remove some important filters to the knee
    jerk reaction of the will of the moment of the busy American citizenry: 1) consideration
    of all sides of an argument, 2) deep experience with past political decisions
    and their ramifications, 3) possibly wisdom gained through this experience.  Also,
    today''s representatives are a responsible party for any decision in that if a
    decision is unpopular with the representative''s constituency, that representative
    is unlikely to be re-elected (as was the case with Edmund Burke in England).  The
    representative also serves as a figurehead or scapegoat for causes where the extension
    (or termination) of that person''s tenure and can be used to trumpet the virtues
    or absolve the citizenry as public opinion on topics change over time. '

    Well said Nate. 

    I counter that a democracy which requires only professional politicians will never achieve what a citizen run nation can. That's not to say that increased citizen contributions couldn't work in tandem with representatives. I'd like to see fewer reps with less power and shorter terms. While we're at a wish list how about public funded only candidates.

    The level of complexity of national laws should be minimized and made clear, additional local qualifications would be used to compliment the core national values. Just talking to my friend who's an officer yesterday made my head spin at the codes he has to memorize. In order to resist the fickle interests of a population, laws should have a momentum feature or half life under which they naturally decay unless reinforced, while at the same time resisting knee jerk reactions without careful consideration. If the majority of a nation wants socialized health care or privatized postal service, they can make it possible by directly influencing the flow of tax revenue to or away from those areas.

<p>In the United States we celebrate our national independence on the 4th of July. The full justification for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution">revolutionary war</a> is a complex topic for a single post. In today's riff I'll briefly discuss the essential causes for the revolutionary war, and wrap up with far out thoughts on a form of democracy we may see emerge around the world in the coming decades.</p>
<p>One of the most well known reasons for the American Revolution is taxation without representation. In short the colonies were taxed without political representation in England. The rationale for revolution was based on heavy handed legislation from England without sufficient local autonomy for the colonies. The bloody outcome is the birth of the US as a nation<sup><a href="#notes">1</a>.</p>
<h2>The Essential Elements of Liberty</h2>
<blockquote><p>
The ideological movement known as the American Enlightenment was a critical precursor to the American Revolution. Chief among the ideas of the American Enlightenment were the concepts of liberalism, democracy, republicanism, and religious tolerance. Collectively, the belief in these concepts by a growing number of American colonists began to foster an intellectual environment which would lead to a new sense of political and social identity.</p>
<p>John Locke's (1632–1704) ideas on liberty greatly influenced the political thinking behind the revolution. John Locke's Two Treatises of Government, published in 1689, influenced American thinking. Locke convinced many of the Founders that among the "natural rights" of man was the right of the people to overthrow their leaders, should those leaders betray the historic rights of Englishmen.[5][6] In terms of writing state and national constitutions, the Americans relied on Montesquieu's promotion of the "balanced" British Constitution.<br />
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution">source</a>)
</p></blockquote>
<p>To read more from John Locke see <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7370/7370-h/7370-h.htm">The Second Treatise on Government</a>, the readable format looks great in Instapaper, or a Mobi format for Kindle. </p>
<p>While the seeds of liberty have been harvested centuries ago, how far does the independence earned back then extend to modern personal freedoms?</p>
<h2>The clash between rules of society and essential freedoms</h2>
<p>The following question struck me as one we may learn the answer to in my lifetime as other nations and to a lesser extent our own, serve as evolutionary experiments of governing systems:</p>
<blockquote><p> Would an alternative form of democracy exasperate or ameliorate the friction between individuals and government authority? Are legislative representatives necessary in times of modern widespread digital infrastructure?
</p></blockquote>
<p>An extreme form of democracy has no limit to its size or scope. In this notional political system elections occur fluidly, sparked by informed citizens and cover all aspects of distributed decision making. Yet this form of headless leadership is vulnerable to group ignorance and poor consistency<sup><a href="#notes">2</a>. In addition there's a necessity for slow decisions to allow a quorum of voters time to understand the details of each election. The real challenge we have yet to see met, <i>can digital network voting outpace congress and outdated election systems</I>?</p>
<p><a href="#notes" id="notes">Notes:</a></p>
<ol>
<li>On a lighter note, US federal and state income taxes today are lower than equivalent English levels (30-40% in the US vs 40-50% in UK ), although the UK has nationalized healthcare.</li>
<li>Republicanism is a core principle of the US government because the founding father's feared mob rule</li>
</ol>
