  content: Hmm, I&#39;d guess that a lot of people probably think to themselves, "what
    the hell does WB do that he deserves 100k life wages, and the burger flipper only
    deserves one?"<br><br>But it&#39;s not really about &#39;deserve&#39;. It&#39;s
    about reality. Did he violate anyone&#39;s rights? no? then he&#39;s morally ok.
    Now, did he do something amazingly wonderful to get that money? Well, maybe, but
    the important thing is that he did it without harming others. What he did resulted
    in success. It&#39;s not about how hard you work, it&#39;s about taking advantage
    of what is real. <br><br>You might really want your computer program to work,
    and you might have even worked very hard on it, but another programmer making
    a simple and easy program which works is the one who succeeds (at having a functional
    program). Reality doesn&#39;t conform to our wishes, and pointing guns (taxes,
    wealth distribution, etc) at people who succeed is the initiation of force, not
    an act of justice.<br><br>Anyways, as the first to comment, I was actually responding
    to my own initial thoughts on the matter, not anyone else&#39;s. I don&#39;t see
    what WB did that was so great, but it worked, and he didn&#39;t use force, and
    that&#39;s what matters.

  content: If a person can earn trillions per year, they should have every right to
    do so.<br><br>I was coming at it from the relative value perspective. I mean I
    make a pretty good wage and I&#39;m pretty sure a buck to me is not the same as
    it is to the person at the food checkout counter. The entire purchase of a meal
    psychologically means very little to me based on my income. Now extrapolate that
    100 thousand or 500 thousand times. <br><br>I&#39;m not saying Warren doesn&#39;t
    deserve his earnings, I&#39;m saying he must see money fundamentally differently
    than I do.

  content: Yeah, I was actually responding to my own initial thoughts on the matter.<br><br>I&#39;ve
    thought about it a bit too. Like, how would Bill Gates play poker? It matters
    when the money matters to you. If he played for $100 pots, it would be as if he
    was playing for fake poker chips. It wouldn&#39;t be the same game for him.

  content: Good breakdown.  This is what annoys me with the entitlement mentality.  I
    have one friend who is very argumentative about these topics.  Except for a few
    with health limitations we all have an chance still to make it big.  Some people
    get lucky and some bust their rear to get somewhere.  I get concerned when people
    say that Warren shouldn&#39;t make that much and the burger flipper deserves much
    more.

  content: 'Mark, first off, this article inspired me to do some thinking. I love
    articles that make me think about the way people perceive the world. Thanks. :)<br><br>Now,
    please allow me to indulge in some shameless self promotion. As i posted on your
    previous article here: <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2010/04/29/the-dark-side-of-the-web-praying-for-perspective-or-prospective-prey/"
    rel="nofollow">http://www.victusspiritus.com/2010/04/29/the-da...</a>  we can
    view all sectors of our life by thinking about them as independent, yet inter-related
    "games".<br><br>Throughout this article, what you have really been doing is looking
    at how players with more or less "game pieces" react to the value of a single
    game piece. If you follow this train of thought, we can compare how people view
    game pieces in a virtual world such as "World of Warcraft" in relation to their
    real-life value.<br><br>Virtual game pieces in "World of Warcraft" , gold, are
    directly linked to real currency. They are an indicator of effort. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming"
    rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming</a>) This has evolved
    to the point that sectors of the Chinese economy are based around virtual currencies.
    And so, to get a perspective on how the mega-earners like Buffet think of a single
    dollar, we can look at how players of "World of Warcraft" think of a single piece
    of gold.<br><br>If you like, you can even try the experiment on yourself. Play
    the game from level 1 to 80 and document your feelings about the relative value
    of a single gold coin.<br><br>If you do this, you will find that as your "earning
    power" or "wealth generation" ability increases, so too does your frame of reference.
    <br><br>For example, in the early levels, level 1-10, a single gold coin would
    be more then enough to completely take care of "living expenses" in the game for
    weeks (at that current level of usage). Thus, for the level 1-10 player, a gold
    coin seems to be a massive divisor of value that can be broken down and used piece
    by piece over a long period of time.<br><br>On the other hand, when we move to
    the level 80 range, we see that players no longer look at gold coins as individual
    units of measurement that can be broken down. Instead, players look at gold coins
    in groups of hundreds or even thousands before thinking about what they can be
    used for.<br><br>At the extreme limits, top players do not even consider gold
    to be valuable at all. At that stage of the game, social connections are much
    more valuable then even an infinite supply of gold.<br><br>This line of thinking
    can be directly applied to the real world. I would argue that our behavior in
    virtual worlds directly mirrors our behavior in the real world and the indicators
    of value... friends, guild status, items, gold... are different in name only.<br><br>If
    applied to the real world, we can see how the five year old boy treasures his
    five dollar bill, the twenty year old part time worker treasures his hundred dollar
    bill, and the big time earner treasures his million or ten million dollar "unit
    of social utility".<br><br>Truly it is not the value of a dollar that changes,
    only our frame of mind in respect to that dollar based on our current position
    in the real-world money game.<br><br>After having gone through this line of reasoning,
    I believe that most of you will come to the conclusion that a man such as Warren
    Buffet does not see money in divisions of less then $100 000, or even $1 million.
    For such a man, it is possible that in his day to day life, money is not even
    considered. <br><br>To close, it is important to note that value means many things
    to many people. Speaking about myself, in many ways, I value love more then sums
    of money, depending on the situation. This is because the "playing field" of relationships
    (love) and the "playing field" of career (money) are inter-related, but not part
    of the same game. Our world is a intricate weave of many games being played at
    once where game pieces sometimes can flow directly (prostituion : love / sex for
    money) or not (love in world of warcraft usually does not equal love in the real
    world).<br><br>Thus when thinking about the value of a dollar, we must keep in
    mind the frame of reference someone is coming from, their personally held beliefs
    they have towards value, and what playing field we are dealing with.'

  content: I think the term "deserves to earn money" is very volatile and should be
    treated with caution. A person with a different frame of reference then mine will
    probably have a different view on what constitutes someone currently "deserving
    to earn that much money".<br><br>One thing I think we all can agree on, however,
    is whether someone deserves to earn "that much money" based on how bad their starting
    position was (how much money they were supplied with from parents and outside
    factors outside of their influence).<br><br>If someone works his way up from being
    a poor child with no family and no connections, and then ending up as a millionaire,
    I believe we can all agree that this man deserves to make millions of $$. <br><br>However,
    if the starting point is from a family providing one with millions of $, we might
    not be so quick to judge someone as deserving to continue making that much money.

  content: 'Hehe, This is a long post, and a lot to respond to, but I wanted to say,
    an interesting thing happens a lot in World of Warcraft: the people at higher
    levels often have such an easier time at things (getting some items, gold, some
    materials) that they will be charitable to the lowbies. Often they give gold,
    but more often, in my experience as a giver and recipient of highbie charity,
    it&#39;s help with a dungeon, or farming some item, or getting through a tough
    quest. <br><br>There&#39;s something about the difficulty difference that makes
    it appealing. It could take the other guy hours of effort and he may not even
    succeed, but when the high level character helps, it takes a couple of minutes.
    <br><br>Of course, it&#39;s most enjoyable to help your friends, or potential
    friends. There are far too many strangers to help every random person that asks
    (and there are a lot of beggars in WoW). On my mage, I would sometimes help people
    get places (by using the teleport spell), but it got to be that I couldn&#39;t
    take the character to a busy town without having people ask every minute or so
    for a teleport, and if you turn them down, they actually get pissy about it.<br><br>Anyways,
    WoW gold is a really big pain to get. It&#39;s so expensive to get a character
    their epic flying mount that it&#39;s almost a barrier to bothering making an
    alt (alternative character). I can understand people buying WoW gold, because,
    as you pointed out, the dollar to them is worth much less of their time that they
    would have to spend grinding out the gold than the time of the gold farmer. <br><br>Btw,
    I&#39;ve quit the game, but a nice way to get a few starting gold is to take gathering
    professions and sell your stuff on the auction house. Prices have inflated a lot
    on the AH, so you can make a lot of money there, relative to vendor sold item
    costs (cost of living stuff at low levels).'

  content: 'Higher level charity to lower level is an exact mirror of real life charity.
    In WOW, higher levels might give charity to foster a relationship between them
    and a lowbie that may become socially powerful later on (real life parallel: VCs
    giving money to startups in the hope they will become successful in the future,
    or giving some angel investment to a friend in the hopes that they make it big).
    I hope i&#39;m not trying to draw too thin of a parallel here. :)'

    connections are much more valuable then even an infinite supply of gold."<br><br>The
    model of multiple overlapping games is a powerful one. We can only influence so
    much of one game&#39;s results at a time with our personal energy. I&#39;m doing
    my best to direct that effort towards a game that creates social and financial
    wealth, as I believe tools of high value can be connected to a prosperous business.<br><br>ps
    I played wow and had a couple of 80s so your analogy is perfect.

  content: Heh. <br><br>BTW, the idea I had in mind for your friend with Ars Vox was
    to consider expanding the concept to multiple blogs, centered on one historic
    event. E.g., take the housing bust. You could collect, curate, and edit posts
    from blogs by house flippers, mortgage brokers, people who owned shares of mortgage
    companies, etc., etc., and intersperse the posts with some milestone/chronology
    markers. Would be a compelling sort of history.<br><br>One tiny example from &#39;07
    sticks in my head, and it wasn&#39;t even a blog post. New Century Financial was
    a client of my inamorata&#39;s company at the time and when it started stumbling
    its stock price dropped, and some unfortunate souls bought it on the way down,
    thinking they were getting a bargain. Then it filed for bankruptcy protection.
    I remember a post on its Yahoo! message board that went something like this, <br><br>"Holy
    shit -- I went out for a quart of milk and I get back to find I&#39;m out 14 grand
    -- that was the most expensive quart of milk in the world".

<h2>The Almighty Dollar</h2>
<p>As I payed for breakfast this morning I couldn't resist the temptation to wonder how a bill captures an essential communication of value and trust. Consider how diverse our relative perception of value must be.</p>
<p>Let's look at a brief list of pay scales and buying power to get a feel for relative income. Let's call a single low end standard of living a Life Wage to compare across categories.</p>
<ul>
<li>The cashier at <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2009/10/10/be-like-panera-bread/">Panera Bread</a> gets paid between $7-8 dollar an hour pre taxes. At that rate full time they can afford to rent a room in a home, barely cover car insurance, or a used car payment, and maybe some ramen noodles. If they have any other debt they're in serious jeopardy of bankruptcy. This is really a breath above poverty and falls between 1/5th -1/3rd of a Life Wage</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A good friend has been working at a lab for a few years and pulls in $20-30 dollars per hour. At this income level some serious school debt can be handled along with other expenses, but a single income at this range isn't enough to purchase a home (without incredible saving, or living outside of my home Long Island). This is a base Life Wage ~50k/year.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As an engineer of a little over 14 years my hourly pay is in the $50-60 dollar range. A mortgage and other debt are balanced pretty well at ~100k/year. In addition <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/tag/victus-media/">sexy side projects</a> can be funded with the mystic resource combo of time and $$. While my hourly income puts me in the 2x Life Wage, my schedule is really part time (30 hours/week)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>While $50/hour is a handsome sum for an hours work, freelance consultants inside and outside of my industry and upper managers can pull in much more, up to a few hundred dollars an hour depending on their resume and historical contributions. I work with some sharp guys, some of which have played the game well with entire walls full of patents, or popular technical books which is like "street cred" in engineering*. Low level financial jobs fall into this range with bonuses. This income is between 4-8x Life Wages ($100-200/hour)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>At the next income step are financial industry investment jobs, skilled doctors &amp; lawyers and executives of small companies. These folks pull in hundreds of dollars an hour ($500-1000/hour). At this performance level massive bonuses, specific cases, or surgeries can account for the majority of pay so the hourly model really breaks down. Successful entrepreneurs and middling performance Angels investors or VCs pull in this level of income as well with the same wide fluctuation of performance. This pay is 20-40x Life Wages</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Successfully exits from mid range entrepreneurs, investments by shrewd VCs, and executives at larger businesses (finance!) are the next step up in the financial food chain.  At this point the hourly model is pretty much worthless as the diversity of pay is all over the spectrum. But if you look at the average hourly pay of this group over a few years they fall in $2000-10,000/hour and 80-400 Life Wages (that's $4-20 million a year at 40hours per week for those keeping score)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How about the all star executives, the bigger startups and exits, the uber investors. These ladies and gents are pulling in $100-500 million a year. The hourly rates make about as much sense as peanut butter on sushi, but for the sake (zing!) of completion at 40 hours/ week this translates into $50,000-250,000 dollars an hour which puts this group at 2000-10,000 Life Wages per year. But wait, there's more!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Every finite list has to stop somewhere, and for the sake of my sanity, I'll stop at this earning level. Mega corporations that go public: Microsoft, Google, Facebook? are good examples. Successful hedge fund partners (Warren Buffet money), and other megalopolies (telecom Carlos Slim) yield yearly income at $1-5 billion dollars per year. That's $500k-$2.5million dollars an hour for the sadistic among us, or 20,000-100k Life Wages a year. This is a teenie tiny count on one hand group of truly eccentrically bizzaro world rich people</li>

<p><a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/EarningsChart.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3749" title="EarningsChart" src="http://www.victusspiritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/EarningsChart.png" alt="" width="500" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>So pondering this list I wondered how Warren Buffet could possibly value a single dollar the same way that the 100 thousand medium income folks, or 500 thousand low income earners who match his yearly income value that same dollar. To put it into perspective what takes a minimum wage worker an hour to make, takes Warren under 8 micro seconds to earn. Imagine how many burgers he can flip an hour? He's that fast. Of course the trick is not to flip burgers, but to grow wealth.</p>
<p>Staggering numbers like these simply do not compute, except when you consider compounded wealth. Warren didn't always make 500,000 times the minimum wage.</p>
<p>After doing a little background reading about W.B. his view on compounding wealth makes sense. He doesn't see it so much as dollars earned, but as percentage of wealth growth. His thinking and maneuvers are longer term. And he consistently pursues a strategy that pays off shifting entire markets and economies with his investments. Here's a tip of the hat to bizzaro world earnings. Hope you enjoyed this list and thought riff as much as me. Good luck consistently growing wealth!</p>

<p>Notes</p>
<p>*= Success in engineering requires a very specific credential hierarchy, or managerial mastery. I like to think of the non-managerial leads as the technorati.</p>
