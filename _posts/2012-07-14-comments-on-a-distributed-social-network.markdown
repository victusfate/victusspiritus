<p>From <a href="http://fatalerror.wordpress.com/2008/02/04/decentralized-social-data-framework-a-modest-proposal/">a modest proposal</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
One of the interesting suggestions that have come out as a result of this is to create a decentralized version of Twitter – much on the lines of IRC – to bring about much better uptimes...</p>
<p>I would take the idea a lot further and argue that all social communication products should gradually turn into aggregation points.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Ownership of communication is the key feature described in the above post from 2008. Both message origin and social connections are managed on a dashboard driven, user centric universe. </p>
<p>I like the basic idea, but it is a goal without a plan. How do you get from where the social web is now to there? The problem is primarily a social one, then economic, and to a much lesser extent technology (UI design, then protocol).</p>
<p>One way to cultivate a community (or company) is a shared vision. The community is organized by it's desire for a distributed social web. The social network is defined by user ownership. If you can help found and sustain that community, you will have a chance of achieving the distributed social network.</p>
