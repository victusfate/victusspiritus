<p>Catching up on startup/tech news after a few days fighting off a cold, I came across an update from Jeff Miller</p>
<p>[blackbirdpie id="1763572493328384"]</p>
<p>In <a href="http://jeffmiller.github.com/2010/11/08/hacker-news-twitter-feeds-with-hashtag-metadata">Jeff's post</a> he goes on to describe a few hashtags he automatically adds based on specific parameters.</p>
<ul>
<li>#guru for HN users with > 1k Karma as of Nov 2010</li>
<li>#active for posts with more than half as many comments as upvotes (comment to score ratio > .5)</li>
<li>#trending for posts that earn more than 20 points per hour. What's interesting about this metadata is that it's not just tracking score but its rate of change. Should identify singularity like posts that capture the attention of the HN  community</li>
</ul>
<p>What we're seeing is another rich layer of information. First social filter sites like HackerNews built up a fan base of reviewers with solid ground rules. Then folks like Jeff saw value in tracking the posts with at least X upvotes and sending them to a feed or twitter accounts for asynchronous consumption. Now analytics are being added about the author, rate of social approval change, and engagement. I see no reason why this trend should slow down. We should expect much richer information working its way into our news feeds. </p>
<p><i>Getting a cozy fit for information will take time and effort</i></p>
<p>Personalization takes work. We won't get exactly the flavor of information we want unless we spend time training knowledge systems about our tastes. Another HN regular Nathan Marz had to punt on the Blekko search engine because it wasn't yielding the quality of keyword results he was accustomed to.</p>
