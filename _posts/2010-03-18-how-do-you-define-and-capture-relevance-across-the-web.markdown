  content: 'Mark,<br><br>This is what I was referring to in my last Tweet: when I
    click the Twitter share icon below, the tweet it turns into is too long for Twitter
    (that&#39;s why I saved the link to this post via Bit.ly). Just an FYI.'

  content: so the imm is now called opengard.in (really like that name) ? or opengard.in
    is the new victus media ? <br><br>the @username way is I believe an interesting
    shift. I would personaly like to see email fade away and be replaced by something
    like that.<br>on relevance, there needs to be a way to publish with a filter applied.
    Just like you would receive content. like prefiltering by the user itself, helping
    the system in learning and adapting the relevant content both ways.

  content: That&#39;s right Laurent, we&#39;re in transition. <br><br>Content creators
    and information curators can both help out by collectively tagging and directing
    content/media. Good point on the filter at creation time.

  content: sweet, opengard.in is easier to mention in a conversation than IMM ;-)<br>about
    filter at creation time, I would say that you have to have statistics available
    at some point (which modularity can make it an easy thing to do). Like did I reach
    people like me ? or did it went in the grave straight ahead ?

    or did it reach people I am able to engage with ?

  content: Buzz has much of that info already, and I think a good deal of it is open,
    so we may be able to reuse their analytics. I&#39;ll make a note to explore this
    desired feature after we get a good landing page, and feed list/organizing page.

<h2>The breadcrumbs were eaten</h2>
<p>In the previous incarnation of opengard.in (in development, formerly imm.victusmedia.com) you could see what your friends (or a lists) main topics discussed were in a moment by typing in the URL /users/twitterusername. Now with the expansion of potential information streams being "the web", there's no guarantee or meaning in /users/victusfate being me (unless I claim that identity on our site). We've had to rethink the way we handle flowing information, and how best to connect that to a user identity. </p>
<p>The biggest challenge for shifting the social tools at <a href="http://victusmedia.com">Victus Media</a> away from a fading legion of twitter-apps, and becoming a world wide web application has been maintaining relevance. It's clear that the url breadcrumb doesn't have the same instant meaning as it once did to the community of twitter users. But identity methods, and the sources of web information we can process has expanding immensely. Where once we could potentially cater to 5 million active users of social media, we now can engage over 1 billion & growing possible web users. </p>
<p>The trick to making the transition is staying focused on relevance, and expand on a simple way of creating order from the chaos of information overload. </p>
<ul>
<li>Relevance to the user means providing an obvious interface, a simplified initial setup, and quality filtering and organizing tools to track their favorite dynamic web sites (social/news/media). </li>
<li>Relevance to other applications translates as accurately representing users expressed interests, for adaptive sites that choose us as a way of customizing their content to a users expressed interests.</li>
</ul>
<h2>We're not like any other social reader/aggregator</h2>
<p>At Victus Media we believe in self curated input channels. But being able to direct one's own info stream doesn't mean you can't borrow the ubiquitous attention of super human filters. Generous folks like <a href="http://blog.louisgray.com">Louis Gray</a>, <a href="http://scobleizer.com">Robert Scoble</a>, <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/">Marshall Kirkpatrick</a>, and <a HREF="http://www.skepticgeek.com">Mahendra Palsule</a> create numerous public web streams that you parse with our filters. We extract entities, or the most important people, place, ideas from as many feeds as we can handle. Simply add your favorite feeds as sources you follow. Our plan is to make it so that users can identify </p>
<ul>
<li>content they create (i.e. this blog, or my Twitter account <a HREF="http://www.Twitter.com/victusfate">@victusfate</a> is me)</li>
<li>or content you wish to keep track of, like some of the mortal portals I mentioned above</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be a feeds overview page to add, delete and organize feeds. We'll work out the details with helpful user feedback.</p>
<p>Mobile and location are additional sources of info we can use to aid in the neverending search for user relevance. The more orthogonal data we can get, the better our suggestion algorithms can eventually get. Our longer term vision leads us down a path that makes a highly functional web agent that can negotiate great deals of data and highlight relevant serendipitous sources browsers may normally miss. The same agent can be used to make each web browsing adventure adapt to our preferences. As our interests change the web agent will shift it's criteria and learn from our recent behavior. </p>
