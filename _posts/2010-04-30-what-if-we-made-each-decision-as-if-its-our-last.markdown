  content: 'I couldn&#39;t agree with this point more. People often think that by
    being comfortable and not taking action, they are safe. I often hear "You want
    to quit your job for your startup? Why would you want to give up all the safety
    of a stable paycheck?" To which I reply: "My day job is one customer. They can
    decide to stop utilizing my services at any time. Whereas in my business, I have
    hundreds customers and what are the chances that they&#39;ll all stop paying?"<br><br>Often
    times the safest road is anything but safe.<br><br>-JP'

  content: Right on JP, thanks for stopping in to say so. I use funds from my part
    time day job to fuel development costs (and keep the lights on). Can&#39;t wait
    until the day when I can count on the business to pay the mortgage.

  content: I think one of the key issues is actively noticing that everything is a
    decision. Most people ignore choices because they complicate things. I recently
    became unemployed which I am viewing as a good thing, because I sort of liked
    my job but in hindsight it was slowly becoming less and less interesting-yet it
    probably would have taken me another year or two before I considered seriously
    looking for another job. People who think they&#39;re safe may not actually be
    as safe as they think; and those on the other side are rarely taking as much of
    a risk as the  safe side perceives. Not taking action IS action, whether you realize
    it or not. Great topic.

  content: Now&#39;s a great opportunity to seek out freelancing work if you&#39;re
    so inclined. oDesk is an up and coming service or use your social network to get
    a first referral. On the other side there may be a small business opportunity
    you can afford to explore.<br><br>Wherever your life takes you, don&#39;t forget
    to bring your passion and enthusiasm. I did for far too long, and I had no idea
    what I was missing.

  content: Just to add JP, I think the decision of whether to go with a more risky
    path in our career must always be balanced upon our current situation in life.<br><br>I
    would put forth that the prudent choice is to attempt to reach a state of financial
    safety as soon as possible. More specifically, I mean forgoing luxuries in our
    daily lives until we have a "safety net" of financial resources built up. This
    would mean working for one or two years in a generic day job, saving money as
    much as possible and skimping on things such as a new TV, luxury car, etc..<br><br>By
    living below our means for a nominal period of time, we can create a safety net
    for ourselves allowing us social, emotional, and geological mobility. When it
    comes down to it, someone with no savings and massive debt cannot afford to do
    risky things such as start their own company/startup. I would understand if you
    said that this person should give up everything in order to pursue a more risky
    choice such as following their dreams, but you must also remember that this person&#39;s
    emotional well-being is also at stake. Living with one&#39;s parents in the pursuit
    of a dream may be too large of an emotional burden to bear for many.<br><br>There
    is a right time to take chances, and there is a wrong time. The best course of
    action is to start safe, stockpile resources, and then go more risky.

<h2>What if We Always Chose the more Interesting Option?</h2>
<p>Where you have ended up today is the result of hundreds of thousands of discrete choices compounded over time. As a thought experiment I wondered what would happen if we always chose the more interesting branch. In the space of most inconsequential decisions, only a small life direction shift would be noticeable. </p>
<h2>Risky or Risk Averse</h2>
<p>Boring choices may lead to extremely interesting opportunities later on, but this thought riff is about always choosing what is more intriguing to us at the time. For the sake of survival we have developed a healthy fear of self destructive behaviors which may conflict with interesting. Always choosing a more interesting path could quickly end in one's demise or other non viable long term lifestyles, so it appears a flawed decision making criteria. But what if there were an optimal interest decision tree just shy of immediate self extinction or self destruction?</p>
<p>My hypothesis is that many of us err on the side of saftey and security by choosing what is known all too often. This form of decision making leads to an over paranoid life style, along with a false sense of security. Life isn't safe. Each of us has a limited duration that will likely end outside of our control. You won't see me hopping on a motorbike or taking life destroying chemicals too often (the downside is a cliff). But I'm pretty certain I won't be on my deathbed looking back thinking I wished I lived a safer life. </p>
<p>Take a walk on the wild side. Give a good friend a bear hug :). There's gotta be a correlation between the people we feel comfortable bear hugging and our joy.</p>
