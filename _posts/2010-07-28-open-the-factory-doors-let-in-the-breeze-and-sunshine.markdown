  content: If the game content is going to mostly home brewed.. *please*, and i can&#39;t
    overstate this enough, include a solid ranking, popularity and quality system
    for searching and sorting through the various content created by people. Nothing
    is worse then the time people have to usually waste finding high quality player-created
    content in other games. <br><br>I LOVE some of the game mods I have played, but
    they are spread all over the place on random forum posts and websites. <br><br>I&#39;m
    sure you have done research on what motivated the original creators of counter-strike
    to create their mod.. if you can enhance that motivation in your game system maybe
    we can see some awesome player created RPG content.

  content: To be honest, I haven&#39;t given it much thought yet. But now that you
    mention it, a crowd voting mechanism makes perfect sense. I&#39;ll look for an
    open source solution / site when we&#39;re ready to go live with the mod site.

<p><strong>Unravelling</strong></p>
<p><em>What we wrap most tightly, gains the greatest benefit by being let go.</em></p>
<p>The act of letting go of ideas here each morning has brought much peace and energy into my life. I've met fine folks who've influenced my worldview with their generous contributions. This lead me to wonder what else I keep bundled up, either out of fear or simply through not knowing any better.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source RPG System</strong></p>
<p>My friend Aakin and I (along with generous contributions from Eli and feedback from others) have spent thousands of hours creating, modifying, play testing, and finally editing a game called <a href="http://victusgames.com/Welcome_to_Victus_Games.html">Children of the Ark</a> or COTA for short. It's a breath away from our first publishing but has been on hold since Aakin has been busy tracking down work. I'd like to release the game in a way that players can share home brewed modifications and even feed back the most popular mods to us for follow on releases.</p>
