  content: The way we maximize our creativity or constrain the imagination depends
    on both external factors such as our environment and the internal factor which
    is our own given relationship between heart and mind.   There is a relationship
    of equanimity between the two which is a starting point, but the end point is
    intention and intensity.   These are the factors which determine our unique ways
    of looking at life.<br><br>It is dangerous to simplify this as cause and effect
    because it is easier to address uniqueness in the biological scripts of conformity.  Why
    would scripts written as language be any more different than the scripts that
    determine human habit and our ability to codify life into the simplest level of
    explanation.  Of course we are not machines, but even our biology recognizes that
    we require a default that operates in the background called our consciousness.<br><br>It
    is also dangerous to view life in parts unless we realize that we break things
    up because very few people can swallow the whole, which is something that those
    who advocate "a holistic view" seem to miss.   It is the parts we choose which
    determine the quality of our own given perspective.  The parts in this case would
    be ideally split into two questions :<br><br><b>1. What maximizes our creativity?<br>2.
    What constrains the imagination?</b><br><br>Note that I don&#39;t want to enforce
    a distinction between designer and end-user here.  A great designer acts like
    an actor on any given project of creativity, whether that be to craft code or
    craft a message.  The role we play must fit our given ability and more importantly,
    our proclivity.  What is it that we want to do with our creative intent?<br><br>When
    we become self-aware of how we use language, not just language we use to create
    programs but the language our particular environment has educated us to see our
    world, then we begin to see how our very language can become a self-imposed an
    unconscious limitation.   Some of this safety is smart because understanding protection
    equates with a duty of care, which depending on the nature of our hearts and minds
    defines how our imaginations lead to creating real safety, or in the search for
    safety, create the opposite reaction.<br><br>The first question "What maximizes
    our creativity?" is a question which matures with a lifetime of experience.  This
    question however is not about the designer&#39;s creativity but the imaginative
    power, which most people would refer to as vision, is our given capability (our
    ripple of imagination) to recognize how life changes for the end-user because
    of our imagination, the end-user in the shoes of the designer and the designer
    playing the role of end-user consequence.<br><br>The second question, what constrains
    the imagination can be studied by looking both at the outliers of society and
    the artists who grasped consequence in their imaginations and tried to articulate
    it with their art.  Andy Kaufman is considered by people to be a comedian but
    in Kaufman&#39;s world he was really a scientist of the human condition.  Kaufman
    saw the absurdity that is a consequence of habit-forming.  What makes us laugh
    in retrospect regarding what Andy Kaufman did is knowing that rather than simply
    having our number as a society, he tried to show how we stop thinking.<br><br>Here
    it is helpful to understand what Marshall McLuhan thought about the word narcissism.  He
    did not see it as selfishness but a derivation of the word narcosis, or in other
    words he looked at media&#39;s narcotic effects on the human condition, and in
    writing "Understanding Media" he was doing the very same thing Andy Kaufman was
    experimenting with, to see if we are really awake.<br><br>When the end-user constrains
    their imagination, more often than not that is a deliberate choice.  Ingesting
    media is no different to taking a magic puff that calms our central nervous system
    and Kaufman was clued into that nervous system and how it operated, while McLuhan
    saw technology as an extension of that nervous system.   For a designer, IMHO
    it is not their role to play G-d with people&#39;s desires, but it is mindful
    for them to recognize whether they want to strike a Faustian bargain with consumers
    and in particular on either their conspicuous consumption or their desire for
    entertaining any form of narcosis.<br><br>There is a principle in lawyer called
    caveat emptor which means "let the buyer beware".   Our responsibility as guardians
    for the next generation should not be undermined and indeed as mentors and guides,
    we should encourage the spark of imagination at the earliest possible point of
    human education, where consciousness begins to take a foothold.   When it comes
    to the world of adults and their free will, the second question is an education
    they have a choice in making.  We do now live in a society where we see more and
    here others can make the determination whether they will settle for less or see
    that question 2 is a fundamental loop that makes question 1 above that much more
    potent and worthy.<br><br>Ultimately the way I look at life is no different to
    the way a surfer dewd would see it.  I have my own trip but I am not putting my
    trip on others, or at least my crude marketing tag line is subconsciously "leave
    me the f#%k alone", which does not sit right with those who lead with either question
    above.  At the end of the day the relationship I most consider is between my heart
    and my mind.  From there I roll the dice whether this may be making me smarter
    or consequentially more stupid than those who will never undertake this consideration.<br><br><b>[Em]</b>

  content: One of the reasons "Viktor Ovurmind" works for me is imagination and exploration.  Today
    I added "Rupy Yuan" into that future mix of my personal explorations, because
    it is good to try things and see where they fall, but this would be anarchy if
    it was simply a random event.  So our imagination has to find the poetic and whatever
    that poetic is how we learn to escape structure and yet at the same time find
    new structure in the escape.<br><br>Many major innovations occur when people have
    gone outside their field of expertise and therefore appreciated a different way
    of doing things.  An example of that would be Toyota creating a part of its core
    philosophy from watching how supermarket is run.  Then there is simply stuff which
    is just off left field such as Einstein imagining himself following a beam of
    light.  <br><br>Where I come often unstuck is premature conclusion and in arriving
    at a conclusion, I have killed off any possibility for imagination and exploration
    to work on me.  Sometimes "that working on me" can be a painful process and sometimes
    blind chance of serendipity.  However it works is not for me to conclude but the
    moment I have arrived at a conclusion, I am working from that point onwards with
    dead ideas, or even ideas that might have found their way into my life simply
    through recency or exposure.<br><br>I look at music as a great example of a form
    of imagination that is based on a core of basic notes but which can proliferate
    into so many forms and different ways.  That is why some people liken the move
    into the information space as the new punk rock or rock&#39;n&#39;roll of our
    time.  It is then whatever way we put it together.<br><br>I think a reason why
    premature conclusion is more common rather than the birth of something new, is
    perhaps attributable to the way we preconceive what innovation should be.  Indeed
    our society is obsessed with innovation to the point we probably kill the goose
    that lays the innovative golden egg.  In my own pursuits I am apt to utilize different
    exposures to music as means of surrendering the logical and structures of reason,
    without expectation of a pay-off or a discovery.  By not wanting something to
    happen, the opposite seems to occur.<br><br>Linkin Park is a good example of musical
    form which can stir my mind to take me away from the literate forms or any professional
    habit I have acquired that subjects me to a more fixed way of looking at things:<br><br><b>In
    Between</b><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMiUrjdOdYE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMiUrjdOdYE</a><br><br><b>What
    I&#39;ve Done</b><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzuo_UObpuA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzuo_UObpuA</a><br><br><b>Somewhere
    I Belong</b><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iCtpuQvydk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iCtpuQvydk</a><br><br>When
    I lay out this music in this way, I am simply appealing to the poetic within me.  If
    there is nothing poetic within to resonate beyond regular behaviour, then I am
    wasting time and I should really apply to Walmart and live the rest of my days
    stocking shelves, but if there is an even a hint of the poetic to fuel exploration,
    then the output is pure imagination.   When we try to forcefit someone else&#39;s
    formula or ideology or theory into something that we have not found within ourselves,
    then we are clones and imitators and there is no difference to this way of being
    than applying for a dead-end job.<br><br>Ultimately, the way we organize work,
    whether it applies due process such as agile or feature creep as described above,
    a new way of working is often just on the other side of the fence.  One way of
    looking at work is how film is made.  I am often left in wonder how a Hollywood
    film project costing millions of dollars can assemble a wide diversity of talent,
    find a common moment on their schedule, deliver a self-contained project and at
    the end of it, go off in their different merry ways.  <br><br>Whether it is the
    infinite possibilities in music or the creative chaos of making a blockbuster
    movie, everything begins with imagination and exploration that is not simply a
    bus load of blog comments all tripping off a linear reaction of awareness.  That
    is why my most stark suggestion is to ignore what it is I say but decide yourself
    what the fruits of your imagination will be. <br><br>That our thinking becomes
    relative is simply a courtesy, an etiquette and a respect which is an important
    dynamic of how we co-exist together, yet our imaginations are only limited to
    the extent we are able to handle the liquor of our own imagination and how we
    turn that fuel into a life worth living.  If we cannot make that form of life
    for own given selves, we cannot do it for another - we can only give as much as
    we gain, and in imagination, it is how we approach this because it is central
    to our own DNA, rather than simply what it means or what its worth as an investment
    in drawing a premature conclusion.<br><br>One of the things I love about coming
    to Victus Spiritus is it provides a lot of white space that seeds my own imagination.  I
    much prefer to observe my "Emeri Gent" emergent form of writing as akin to a Mission
    Impossible tape.  Having thought this, hopefully these ideas will self-destruct,
    but the residue of that is an intelligence called my own learning and personal
    discovery.  Imagination therefore isn&#39;t something one can program, it is merely
    something one can develop by learning how to be generous in its movement and application.<br><br><b>[Em]</b>

    rel="nofollow">http://markzorro.blogspot.com/2010_07_18_archiv...</a><br><br>I
    created Mark Zorro over a decade ago as a reactive push back to the hard push
    on personal branding, the adage of which was "imagination is limited by brand,
    personal brand is limited by prostitution".   When I say "Mark Twain wasn&#39;t
    Mark Twain", it means that we generally only care for the brand and so personal
    brand can lead us to think superficially.  <br><br>I am not against branding,
    great branding is great branding, but the proliferation of brand simply for the
    sake of mass personal brand is in my book a complete load of marketing-attention
    deficit disorder.<br><br>Today, I now can navigate across my four twitter accounts,
    all set up for my own learning purposes.  What I do is not meant to be a showcase
    but a personal journey.  That is why I name the whole thing my FREEDOM OASIS.   <br><br>Until
    my own path is voided by the thought police or the desire to market us into something
    other than the exploration of our own individual freedom, I will enjoy this FREEDOM
    OASIS of mine, but in the course of enjoying it, come across some really neat
    people like yourself.<br><br>Must yet again go on my merry explorative way, plus
    I have a commitment to an upcoming project.  Even this FREEDOM OASIS does not
    prevent mortal souls like me from the responsibility of making a living :-)<br><br>Cheers<br><b>[Em]</b>

<p>As most of you are well aware, there are fanatics on both sides of the feature fence. Microsoft is known for spooky bloatware, while 37 Signals holds minimalism sacred*. While I acknowledge the benefits of rich features or dedicated lean apps, I don't believe either of these philosophies are focused enough on my dearest design priority, minimizing constraints on creativity.</p>
<h2>Who's Creativity?</h2>
<p>Myself, other developers and users can all stake a claim on constrained creativity. Much like modern publishing, the distinction between content creators (developers) and end users is becoming a matter of degree in lieu of distinct roles. So the question becomes are we maximizing our creativity as designers or are we limiting how much we constrain the imagination of end users. The answer is clearly dependent on the intended consumer - our self or others.</p>
<p>37 signals hit upon an interesting union of these requirements. They built Rails for themselves, but decided to share their creation with anyone else who was interested. And it took off with a life of its own, marketing Ruby as a potent scripting language and even inspiring alternative frameworks. For my personal work, I'm happy if I can free up my own ideas with well designed code, or if I put something on github that others can use.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>* =  Exceptions: <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/microsofts_star.php">Start.com</a> was a lean project within Microsoft (referenced in <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real</a> by 37 signals), and 37 signals' Rails framework is a bit portly compared to <a class="zem_slink" title="Merb" rel="homepage" href="http://www.merbivore.com/">Merb</a>, <a href="http://ramaze.net/">Ramaze</a>, <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> or <a href="http://camping.rubyforge.org/">Camping</a> for focused web development</p>
