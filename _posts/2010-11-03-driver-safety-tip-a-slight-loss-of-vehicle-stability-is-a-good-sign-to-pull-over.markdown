    and believe me I was worried.  Five years I had a flat tire. The car was shaking
    and I had a hard time controlling the steering wheel.  I called Dad using my cell
    phone and someone was there to tow the car and change the tire in a short time--I
    was only down the block from home and felt very lucky.\r\n\r\nGlad to hear all
    turned out well and hope to see you soon.\r\nLove, Mom\r\n"

    Hah, the passengers with me were pretty supportive. It was a different auto experience than I'm used to, but 400 miles later were all back home.

    I missed my wife Michelle who usually serves as navigator and copilot. She preps me for turns as they come up on her phone gps.

    few times by crazy hawaiians and the 'donut' popped. my brother and i had to hitch
    a ride with a surfer to get back to hana town, they didn't have any tires so we
    bought some fix-a-flat and some sticky rope things to jam in the tire. then we
    drove the car into town and bought a new tire

    I can't imagine getting a flat down there. The road gets so narrow and goes on forever. The sticky rope tire repair is news to me.

    Hope all's going well. Plenty of great events happening in Portland. Some cool stuff happens in Manhattan, but the times make it tough to attend.

<p>At one point I was forced to break rapidly and pull slightly on to a curb while on a road trip with coworkers yesterday evening. It was a blind turn into the setting sun and I was in the wrong lane next an 18 wheeler. After the huge tractor trailer and traffic passed we pulled back on past the bumping curb and drain, and continued driving for another 10 minutes. It was during this time that the car felt like the alignment was out of whack. I was a little worried, but figured I could drop off  the vehicle after the trip to have it fully checked out.</p>
<p>What had happened was that there was a tiny fracture in the tire and it was very low on air pressure. We were basically driving on three supporting wheels and a flat. A large buzzing noise was the sign of the blow out, and I quickly and safely pulled off the high way. At that point we were only about a mile away from a service area, so I was hoping to get there at a crawls pace on the flat. Unfortunately the tire was shredded and we'd be riding on the rim so I discarded that option. My XTerra requires some funky post with a crank to lower the full spare, of which I was completely clueless. RTFM has never been truer, and all the info was in the car manual. Luckily an officer stopped and called in a mobile service guy to give me a hand. Thanks unknown highway patrol and road service guys, your aid was much appreciated. </p>
<p>While nothing tragic occurred from the blow out, I thought it was worth relating the incident to any other motorists who may find themselves in a similar situation. Any slight feeling of loss of control of a vehicle is worth pulling over and inspecting carefully. Just make sure you pull far off the highway or into a service area, the shoulder on highways is a dangerous place to be out of your vehicle. </p>
