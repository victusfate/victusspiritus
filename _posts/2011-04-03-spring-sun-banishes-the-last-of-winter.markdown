<p>The winter has finally thawed with spring's refreshing kiss. This morning Michelle and I strolled through Old Westbury Gardens and were transported to an enchanting world far away from the dark and cold claws of winter. We were temporarily spirited away from never ending tasks, responsibilities, and the cares that haunted us for the past few months. My time is short today, but I'd like to share a few of images I captured while we wandered the grounds. In case your stuck inside wrestling with work, perhaps you can get a brief sense of the wonder and awe that fortune granted us, and sneak outside for a breath of fresh air.</p>
