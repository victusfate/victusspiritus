<h1>The First of Many Voices of Linux</h1>
<p>This share is from a collection of comments gathered by <a href="http://jibnotes.com/">Jeremy Andrews</a> (thanks Jeremy) in a post on kernel trap back in 2002, <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/11">Linux: Linus Says, Linux Not Designed; It Never Was</a>. In it he goes over how Linus Torvalds views technological design versus evolutionary engineering.</p>
<p>This was one of my favorite posts early on (from Linus), but I highly recommend reading the entire series:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">You know what the most complex piece of engineering known to man in the whole solar system is?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Guess what - it's not Linux, it's not Solaris, and it's not your car.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">It's you. And me.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">And think about how you and me actually came about - not through any complex design.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Right. "sheer luck".</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Well, sheer luck, AND:<br />
- free availability and _crosspollination_ through sharing of "source code", although biologists call it DNA.<br />
- a rather unforgiving user environment, that happily replaces bad versions of us with better working versions and thus culls the herd<br />
(biologists often call this "survival of the fittest")<br />
- massive undirected parallel development ("trial and error")</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">I'm deadly serious: we humans have _never_ been able to replicate something more complicated than what we ourselves are, yet natural selection did it without even thinking.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Don't underestimate the power of survival of the fittest.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">And don't EVER make the mistake that you can design something better than what you get from ruthless massively parallel trial-and-error with a feedback cycle. That's giving your intelligence _much_ too much credit.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Quite frankly, Sun is doomed. And it has nothing to do with their engineering practices or their coding style.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> Linus</span></p>
