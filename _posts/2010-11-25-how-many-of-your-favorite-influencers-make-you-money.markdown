    And a mighty fine lunch it was, Michelle and I had a great time at <a href="http://www.hobees.com/redwood.html" rel="nofollow">Hobees</a>.

    I did think about it, but it was in the generous gift category. Our partnered fortunes have yet to be made ;).

    happy thanksgiving Denny

    Don't feel bad...I bought him lunch too and I didn't even make the list of influencers ;-)

    Also - can you put a price on knowledge? friendship? creative inspiration?  These are all things I get (and I suspect Mark gets) from these types of sources as well.

    Money is a direct signal on ROI...but I think it's kind of a horrible one...very few people look back on their life and say I wish I made more money for the things I did (Gary V. recently reminded me of this point in his TechStars talk).

    To me, it's not about how much money I can make from the people I pay attention too...it's how much I can help them make so they'll keep doing what they are doing (so I can selfishly continue to get all those other benefits I mentioned I get from the people I follow)...

  content: "Howdy Louis, Happy Thanksgiving.\n\nYou can do better, keep on iterating
    the power of my6sense's relevancy and taste information. Perhaps a future version
    will create a personal database that's fully under my control. \n\nI'm anxious
    to have a virtual assistant that can negotiate data exchange on my behalf. Kevin
    Marshall's knowabout.it is accelerating in this space."

    I left off too many influencers, darn these lists. You've one upped our blogging friends and crafted an app that influences my behavior, which is amazing. I'm interested in capturing and profiling my own interest data and sharing it with others that share my eccentricities.

    The obvious signal on the social value of our work is liquid capital. Knowledge and wisdom are a form of capital that are tougher to judge, but have value that is far more resilient than currency. No doubt, I value many voices and creative builders for both dollars and sense.

<p>I tune into a few dozen bloggers/authors regularly. The topics range from inspiration, to investors, to tech, to entrepreneurs. I enjoy and respect all the sources I regular read or listen to. This morning after reading Seth's <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/11/a-modern-thanksgiving.html">Happy Thanksgiving post</a>, it occurred to me that out of everyone I pay attention to (without exception) over the past couple of years, he's the only one that's made me any money (with <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/lensmasters/messel">squidoo</a>). By looking at cash as a direct signal of return on investment (ROI), the rest of the information I consume has had little return thus far. Maybe next year those numbers will change.</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving to all who celebrate a harvest festival, whether or not it's this time of year.<br />
