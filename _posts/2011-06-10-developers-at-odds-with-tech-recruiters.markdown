    Really great dialog Mark. Like the way you set it up.

    That being said, I just disagree with the following big time. 

    "Hackers are smart enough to know that great companies don’t need recruiters".

    Just not true in my experience. Maybe for the first 10 hires, but whether you are scaling your team from 2-20 or your company from 30-75 or more, you will find that your networks are never broad enough.

    I will admit that great recruiters are a rarity. But then again, great anything is as well.

  content: "I direct the recruitment function for the US HQ of a global tech/electronics
    leader. I am on the corporate side and I think some of what Mark alluded to is
    spot on, and holds true moreso on the agency recruiter model (e.g. Winter Wyman)
    than corporate, although neither are close to effective. Let me share two brief perspectives
    on the tech market and this post. \n\nFirst, the dev market is super tight from
    my view, and talented developers are in the catbird seat at the moment (and have
    been for a while). Our organization does very limited engineer/developer staffing,
    but when the need arises I know I am in for some pain. This is also one of the
    rare moments I will leverage some external resources outside of my corporate team.
    Have to. My internal customers have even less patience than the external candidate
    market for these types of openings.\n\nAnd to echo what Andy above said, great
    companies absolutely need \"recruitment\", especially if there is any scale. Your
    comment might allude to the fact that great companies do not need recruiters to
    attract talent...their reputation will do that. That echos in some ways Fred Wilson's
    blog earlier this year regarding crappy products are the only ones that need to
    market/advertise. I could see what you are saying from that standpoint. But if
    there is any scale needed in staffing an organization outside of organically growing
    one to two people over a modest period of time then you truly need \"recruitment\".
    I specify recruitment rather than recruiters because for any talent attraction,
    assessment and hiring process to scale you need some level of an efficient process
    to manage, traffic and identify your new hires. Take an example such as a company
    who does 85% of its hiring through internal referrals. That would seem to speak
    to your organic attraction perspective. But if you are talking about a company
    that is running with as few as 15-20 openings that still requires a recruiter
    or some level of process to execute the hiring plan.\n\nIf you truly want to evolve
    your perspective might I suggest attacking the problem of scaling and bringing
    transparency to the recruitment space using today's tech. It is still ripe for
    disruption; the problem is every new solution is about how to deliver job postings
    to a social media outlet or some sort of horrific eharmony for jobs. Nobody has
    realized that the money opportunity is in transforming this scaling issue...and
    then the actual paying customers, the companies themselves not the candidates,
    will flock to that solution. Agency fees hover at 25% of base salary because the
    staffing environment is ineffective..not because the agency is adding that dollar-level
    of value. \n\nThanks for the post. I am passiinate about the woes of the job space
    and tend to rant... :)\n"

  content: "Great comment. Thanks!\n\nI presume you are correct. I was looking at
    this from my own perspective, mostly the small to medium business on a growth
    curve.\n\nIf yo are 20 people with market traction and just did a big raise, you
    need talent across the board. A great recruiter can make this process more efficient
    and more expedient. \n\nGlad to discover another way to handle this, but haven't
    found one as yet.\n\n"

  content: "You're helping me see the difference between the corporate core and culture,
    and the ramp up phase of a company strapped to a rocket engine of a market. \r\n\r\nNo
    doubt Zynga, Twitter or Facebook could have filled their talent demands on word
    of mouth alone. \r\n\r\nThe stage I'm describing is too small for professional
    recruitment and also post market exposure. \r\n\r\nI'm still convinced that money
    can't buy love, and folks who love their craft and the driving company mission
    are essential to any corporate core."

    Agree


    But just like there are developers who love their craft and marketers who make the company's vision their own, there are recruiters who passionately believe in themselves as matchmakers with a purpose.

    Left out a "not" above as in the ultra rapid growth companies could not have grown organically fast enough.

    Agree that there are folks who love their craft as recruiters. Donna White come's to mind :).

  content: In my experience (larger corporate) those that love their craft and identify
    with a company mission are rare, and typically "A" level players...so they usually
    do have a higher compensation requirement whether they are into it for the mission
    or the money. "A" players simply cost more, as they should.

  content: "Disruption needs to happen in the middleware portion of the recruiting
    experience with an overlay of transparency throughout for the candidate. This
    is very possible with the current mobile and social tools at our disposal. By
    middleware I mean the black hole instance between resume submission and first
    cut candidate idenitification. \n\nAn algorithm has not and will not solve this
    issue, and the myth that agency vendors claim only eyeballs and their old school
    \"network\" can solve it is a worn approach and overpriced. The opportunity is
    combining a tech solution which improves the \"cutting\" process without entirely
    elminating a recruiter's eye.\n\nNow if I could just get another Long Island-based
    startup-minded individual to join me on this journey...preferably one with a strong
    technical inclination...hmmmm :)"

    Keep me in the loop John,

    Recruiting is job #1 for every company. Teams make companies work.

<p>"The job of the smart business person isn’t to fish in waters where coders are cheap. It’s to have enough initiative and vision that the best coders in the world will realize that they’ll do better with you than without you." - <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/04/in-search-of-a-biz-monkey.html">Seth Godin</a></p>

<h2>Recruiter Vision</h2>
<p>I've met some incredibly pleasant, friendly, and genuinely kind technical recruiters. The friction arises when a subset of recruiters see developers as a piece of real estate that they have to move in order to generate revenue. The extremely negative perspective of recruiters is born from the notorious few who wear a friendly demeanor, but treat engineers as a piece of meat that is best chopped up and served at the butcher.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of work devs are looking for, head hunters will try and shoehorn them into any role at a company willing to pay hefty premiums on new hires. This motivation is at odds with being a great fit between both the candidate and the company.
</p></div>
<div class="hbox bluebox right">
<h2>Developer Perspective</h2>
<p>Sharp hackers loathe recruiters. Hackers are smart enough to know that great companies don't need recruiters. Legendary companies are known by their name alone. Their best employees already hang out in the right places (real or virtual) to attract more talent.</p>
<p>Developers talk. If a company has an awesome culture and is working on fantastic problems, engineers and designers will beat a path to their door. Epic technical companies form like a coral reef around a core of super sharp founders. </p>
<p>Hackers compare the organic growth strategy, to the image of unleashing an army of recruiters who rip through resumes like fat guys tearing through a brownie wrappers (I eat fast).

<h2>My 2 cents on looking for work</h2>
<ol>
<li>It's hard to find a great fit, and could take years. Take work that you need to survive, but keep your eyes and ears open. Companies and people change. The job you loved a few years ago may not be the best fit for the type of work you need to do today</li>
<p><br/></p>
<li>Do great work. That means finding and doing work you love. Discover tough technical problems, and build solutions that work. Do it again. There's no better way to build a positive reputation than by repeatedly doing solid work</li>
<p><br/></p>
<li>Be generous. Contribute to open source. Blog about your findings. Whether you're patching bugs or sharing your own findings, throw some code up on the web and blog it up. Down the road you'll save someone a few hours who's struggling with the same issues you did.
<p>Unfortunately the half life for tech blogs and code is shrinking, so you'll have to work to keep your posts current. </p>
<p>Don't be discouraged by critical feedback, that's your reward</li>
<p><br/></p>
<li>Try not to be an ass when recruiters contact you. I failed at that yesterday, my apologies <a href="http://www.nyctechnically.com/">Kainne Hansbury</a>. Politely tell them you're not interested</li>
<p><br/></p>
<li><b>Work out a trial basis</b> with a potential hiring company so you or the company can part ways without any hassles or false expectations</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>That last rule of thumb is based on how I perceive the global market changing over the next decade for highly skilled work forces. Multi-year long, full time positions will become the great minority (core company teams). They the predominance of life long labor is a vestigial artifact of the industrial economy. Technical experts will be sought after by public and private reputation, and through their personal networks.</p>
<p>Elite businesses that dominate the network economy will function with smaller permanent staff who own a share of the success (or failure) of a company. Companies will hire a small legion of talented consultants for specific projects. Many of the fluid work force may regularly work together in loose company like formations (aka the Hollywood model). A dynamic work force will better serve the needs of a rapidly shifting market place.</p>
<p>Consider the following hypothetical example: This month ACME needs a handful of designers to help put the finishing touches on their latest packages. But the past several months they staffed up with dozens of engineers and technicians to build captivating yet bizarre products. ACME's ideally staffed to meet the expected ramp of demand brought on by WSGDC, Wiley's Super Genius Developer Conference, and has no problems trimming down afterwards.</p>
