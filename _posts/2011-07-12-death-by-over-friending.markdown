    Concur with the sentiment here Mark; well said.

    For us, the primary communication path through FB is via our MISSIcom business page to share with our followers any snippets we think are news worthy relative to folks interested in, or involved in, building business. Most of what we follow on the personal page relates to news from other sources of business interest that may be worth sharing via our MISSIcom page.

    Otherwise, we have only a couple of family members in our FB Friends group and so, aside from them, we just focus on sending "happy Birthday" messages to those with whom we feel we have a closer relationship.

    Often find that, if you step away for even a relatively short while, the News Feed stream on teh personal page piles up quickly to as many as 310 unread messages and there is no practical way to review that volume so, for the most part, tweets become our primary source of update news.

    I can't suggest a way to make Facebook into something less like "drinking from the firehose" as Slashdot puts it.  I pulled the plug on Facebook for almost the same reasons myself last year: http://goo.gl/ChVjN but your comments above really resonate with me.  These are problems that it seems should be very simple to solve, if I only had a couple million in VC funds maybe I could knock it together myself ;)  
    It appears that G+ suffers from some of the same problems as you describe with Facebook, except of course that right now there are more people on G+ who share my interests so it isn't as bad.  One thing I'd like to be able to do (on any social networking site) is collapse the posts so that they appear as single lines more like a threaded conversation in gmail so I could quickly scan the general sense of the posts and dive into the ones I like.

    another thought would be to have some way to organize stuff in a \"thread\" like
    fashion and also to be able to Tag and filter by tags with tags representing topic
    streams a la hashtags in twitter.\n      "

  content: Yes - the volume of stuff is so overwhelmingly huge that theres no real
    way you can review it all with the result that older stuff just gets buried which
    speaks to Marks point - there needs to be a way to filter the stuff so that things
    you're interested in percolate to the top.  Peter had suggested tags might be
    a way to solve this.  I think something more akin to slashdot methodology where
    you score the posts and set up keywords in your profile (you can call them tags
    I guess) which would modify a post by a (+1).  The algorithm could get intense
    - posts from friends gets a (+2), posts which have been (+1) modified by a friend
    get a (+1), post is one of five posted in the last hour (-1), etc.  This could
    be so easily implemented.

    Yes Mark I agree as well. Do you have any comments about Linked-In? It seems like linked-in contacts might be a more fertile ground for getting the updates directly relevant to what you are interested in. However... so far Linked-In doesn't seem to really promote a lot of sharing behavior by people. Perhaps it's an area that they could start diving into? 

    Also, how is Google + working out for you in regards to this problem? Not enough people on yet to really say?

    Hi Mark....

    Great discussion.

    You can't 'fix' Facebook because it isn't broken. It simply is what it is. You know me and the lack of contextual filtering on Facebook is well...infuriating and by design it's general focus on friends makes it unworkable and useless for a lot of purposes.

    Three comments:

    1. 4.75% of my blog traffic came from Facebook over the last year. Not a lot, not many of those people comment on my blog but that is their channel for my news. I don't get engagement with them on FB, but if that is their channel and they are interested, I send it to them there. I cause 'noise' for the remainder but that can't be helped.

    2. Some groups just like it there. Wine groups. European organizations especially seem to 'like' it so I find that more and more, these groups (through fan pages) are asking me to join and since I am interested and few have sites or blogs or vertical communities, I make that choice whether to keep in touch with them there.

    3. Fan pages have real value for companies at times. I have my clients build and use them. Yes, they are a mess. Yes, they are built for the preference of big brands who can do app development as marketing campaigns but they do have value. 

    One of my clients went from 0 to 75 fans and from 1-4% of traffic on their commerce site from FB during that time. There is more value to come.

    I am pragmatic about FB. I have old friends who only use it for even email. I'm pleased to connect with them.  

    For me personally, I, like you, am conceptually unhappy with many parts of it. But, in what I do, that is help my companies grow and build channels for my own biz, it's a useful tool.

    Sorry for the very early morning pragmatism here ;)

    or you could hook your facebook into your knowabout.it account, don't bother visiting facebook much after that and instead just check your daily knowabout.it feed...and wha-la, problem fixed.

    This is actually one of the main problems I started knowabout.it to fix...and it's one of main ways I (and a few others who have caught on) are really taking advantage of knowabout.it so far...

    Also thanks for the mention in the post about knowabout.it...my comment above was mostly intended for those reading the post...not you specifically (since I know you already take advantage of knowabout.it for some social filtering) ;-)

    BTW - my knowabout.it recommendations for today is actually how I first came across this post as well...*love* when it works this well!

    That's what I like to hear, some stats and recognition that Facebook "is what it is". Morning pragmatism is more than welcome.

    I think I've come to that realization over a long period, but as Kevin suggests KnowAbout.it could help me get a little more inbound value out of it.

<p>This will come as little surprise to astute social network users:</p>
<blockquote><p>I reconnected on Facebook and rediscovered the network of everyone is pure noise</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm pretty active online and enjoy reading, commenting, coding, and contributing towards topics that spark my interest and enthusiasm. Last year I decide to cut ties with Facebook, because each visit there felt like a net loss of my precious free time.  After warming up to Google+ my interest in large connected networks was renewed and I decided to give Facebook another try. After all, it couldn't hurt to catch up with old friends.</p>
<p>This time I friended a small kernel of folks that I wanted to reconnect with, but didn't see, email, or talk with regularly. It spiraled out of control far too quickly as the Facebook friend suggester kept feeding me like a starving hippo at an all you can eat buffet. My friend list grew quickly beyond a tight group and now I've received, accepted, and even sent friend invites to dozens of folks that I haven't seen or talked to in years. Individually I'm confident I could have a fun conversation with anyone I've friended on the network, but all their updates combined felt like a meaningless mess. On Facebook, the sum is certainly less than the parts. </p>
<p>Worst of all, very little of my self created Facebook inbound hell is close to anything resembling an area I'm interested in. No web hacking or design, little tech, no startups, and a few terrible Facebook game updates shared by friends. It is clear to me that following a broadcast stream which is the sum of all people I've ever known is not valuable, and that I'll need to take drastic filtering action to make better use of the weakest information graph.</p>
<h2>Polite hiding</h2>
<p>First off I'm going to try ruthlessly hiding posts from anyone who's updates have little chance of resonating with topics I'm interested in. The topics that catch my fancy are fairly broad so I likely won't achieve much with this first effort. I assume there's a view all option so if mood and free time both coincide I can once again dip into the fire hose of everyone. </p>
<blockquote><p>
I'm a firm believer that each of us can have only a handful of meaningful close relationships in a lifetime. I find it socially satisfying spending greater time with fewer people. It can take years to ease folks into my snarky wiseass remarks, and for me to recognize their finest attributes ;).
</p></blockquote>
<p>There have to be additional tools which can help me harness the pearls buried within my friends news streams. I'd like to extract the fascinating posts topically, and differentiate them from updates which fail to register. I'll turn to KnowAbout.it and other social filtering tools to help at this level.</p>
<h2>Photobook?</h2>
<p>I've considered filtering out all updates but images. That would transform Facebook into another flavor of Flickr or Instagram, and it may prove to be a viable alternative. I could quickly glance at a wall of images and explore further when a picture grabs my attention.</p>
<p>I'm open to suggestions of how others have adapted their Facebook usage to derive maximum value from the app. If you have any Facebook advice I'm all ears.</p>
