<p>While exploring the relation between change and response, I struggled with how best to frame such a general idea. My thoughts gravitated to the floorÂ decision making framework of psychology, and the key observable of personality. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The decision making portion of reaction is driven by intuition, experience, reason, and analogy. We have three broad categories of response to a change in expected plans:<br><br></p>
<ul><br><br></p>
<li>try and enforce the original plans</li>
<p><br><br></p>
<li>adapt our schedule and strategy</li>
<p><br><br></p>
<li>cancel participation</li>
<p><br><br>
</ul>
<p><br><br><br />
Motivation for a specific outcome, the importance of the planned goal, and the relationship between collaborators all weigh into the decision making aspect of reactions to change.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
<h2>How Personality Relates to Reactions</h2>
<p><br><br><br />
A course measure of persona is to look at an average response to change. On average people are predisposed to react in a manner that reflects their personality. We have two poles of emotional response <br><br></p>
<ul><br><br></p>
<li>freak out</li>
<p><br><br></p>
<li>calmly decide on a course of action</li>
<p><br><br>
</ul>
<p><br><br><br />
Most of us have personalities which <strong>drift</strong> between roid rage and ice man, but most of the time we identify with one pole over the other. Final fantasy game mechanics nailed this idea with <em>breakpoints</em>. We all start out calm but as events push against our desired outcomes, we become increasingly frustrated.<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
<h2>Retraining Instincts</h2>
<p><br><br><br />
The subtitle is a bit of a misnomer, as we can't directly hack our proclivity to change response. But we can observe and eventually influence ingrained habits*. Drawing an analogy from addiction:<em>The first step to breaking addiction is recognizing you have a problem</em>. The first step to optimizing your reaction to unexpected change is knowing your default reaction.</p>
