<p>Not long back I wrote about <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2010/10/01/malleable-web-surfaces/">malleable web surfaces</a> and the browser plugin <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2010/10/08/quick-customization-for-twitter-or-any-web-user-interface/">Stylish for customizing stylesheets</a>. The example I shared was a retro modification of the twitter web UI with a larger content area and narrower sidebar. Since that time I couldn't put the idea of personal HTML data views down. Web data that is openly shared suffers a restriction on how it's composed that is easily remedied with adaptive web portals.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Could the browser plugin idea of stylish be extended or mimicked with JavaScript? </p>
<p>Can the the process of crafting web portals be made more social? </p>
<p>Should it be?</p>
<p>Yes, yes and yes!
</p></blockquote>
<p>Today I began working on a visual web design tool called <a href="http://victusfate.github.com/CC/">Connected Canvas</a> that leverages javascript to make most aspects of web pages configurable. There's not much of anything in the repository yet. I have to overcome some technical hurdles highlighting div and partitions and adding visual interface frames. Luckily there's already an excellent utility for the task at hand. </p>
<p>jQuery and jQuery UI are rich toolkits for selecting page portions and modifying them on the fly (selector, draggable). There are a few outstanding design decisions I have to make to easily share customized interfaces: new html files, unique urls (like jsfiddle), shared database, etc. I've seen what services like <a href="http://netvibes.com">Netvibes</a> have done with portal crafting, but I'd like to take the concept further and open up UI adaption to all existing web sites.</p>
