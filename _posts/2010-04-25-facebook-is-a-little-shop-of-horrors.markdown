  content: Sounds like an interesting idea Mark. BTW, there is an image/hyperlink
    hovering over your text in the second sentence of your post.

  content: Aha, the free template I swapped to had a position absolute, which I&#39;ve
    quickly remedied into a position relative. Thanks for spotting that, should be
    on the bottom of the site/page now.<br><br>By the way if you&#39;re interested
    in converted some old posts into an ebook format, Aakin&#39;s your man. I think
    a rich free ebook is worth much more than $500-1000 (20-40 hours) in marketing
    dollars in the long run, certainly if it&#39;s cost to share is zero.

  content: I read it and commented. Great points of warning about privacy concerns.
    We do have many choices about how to be social online, but we can&#39;t choose
    which networks our friends will be active on. The sooner full social web data
    migration occurs, the better. Many open standards are working to make that possible,
    but there&#39;s an ongoing issue of privacy and only anonymity can protect that.

  content: Thanks for stopping in Ahad. I&#39;ve been blogging pretty consistently
    since Feb in 2009 (about once per day). Glad you enjoyed the government reference,
    when social web becomes a utility it crosses the boundary from optional tool to
    a communication system people rely on (and may have rights to use).

  content: Not your fault the comment was on Ars Vox, when I accidentally nuked and
    restored my blog disqus got a little confused. Future comments should be ok.<br><br>I
    haven&#39;t read rails way much, it&#39;s not on me while walking so I read blogs/ebooks
    (Design patterns in Ruby is rocking). It&#39;s a great reference though. Helped
    a friend setup his first Mongrel localhost last night.

Audrey2's now infamous line "Feed me Seymore" is how I perceive the social information flow model of <a class="zem_slink" title="Facebook" rel="homepage" href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>. I can't blame them, so far their strategy has worked brilliantly. Even as a stubborn proponent of closed data models, I see value in adding Facebook hooks to my pages. The pact is the chance for viral visibility in exchange for semantic relationship data sent back to Facebook. Look no further than the "Like" button in the sidebar to see how I feed Audrey2. My philosophy on closed systems has progressed. If we're all part of a closed system, then it comes down to a question of control which leads to government.</p>
<p>If a single <a class="zem_slink" title="Corporation" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation">corporate entity</a> has majority control over the social web and information derived from it, it won't be long before it becomes a government regulated industry. The concerns for freedom of information, and <a class="zem_slink" title="Individual rights" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_rights">individual rights</a> will come into conflict with a business making those decisions. My hypothesis: <em>the longer Facebook keeps it's information and social network sealed off from full portability, the more likely it is for government interference to end the autonomy of the Facebook corporation</em>. Facebook won't be able to legally "kick out" citizens, because social information sharing will be on par with other government regulated utilities. The choices Facebook leadership makes now, will have long term ramifications for the neutrality of data on the web. I suspect it is in their best interest to make relationship and social data fully open and distributed as soon as possible to avoid heavy handed government interference. They may then continue to iterate on optimal social filters and competitive social tool development.</p>
<p>This is the type of trend that <a href="http://www.dst-global.com/">Digital Sky Technologies</a> should be hyper sensitive to. If the US government begins regulating social web activities it could seriously hamper the growth of their massive investment in Facebook and other investments in that space.</p>
