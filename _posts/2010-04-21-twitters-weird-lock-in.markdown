    a good question. I think Twitter provides real value mostly to those who are already
    famous or niche-famous; it gives them another channel to market themselves. For
    the rest of us... not so much.

  content: I can think of one  (and only one) quality that is unique to Twitter -
    it&#39;s dynamic randomness. I believe that originally it was built on this "magic
    of unknown" - talking to yourself magically transformed into talking to people.
    I believe it still has that quality but it is to rundown with social-noise for
    it to appear. <br><a href="http://www.iamronen.com/2009/07/lets-do-twitter/" rel="nofollow">http://www.iamronen.com/2009/07/lets-do-twitter/</a><br><br>How
    about putting words to action - let&#39;s start with you and me :) & WordPress...  and
    well... everyone else who already has a self-hosted WordPress website:<br> - Create
    a plugin that is a short status/messaging tool in the admin<br> - Actual messages
    can be stored as customt type posts<br> - Distribution can be achieved with PuSH
    & rssCloud<br> - Enable people to follow me - by either adding these updated to
    the existing stream or creating a separate stream.<br> - Enable me to to follow
    people by adding their streams to my Admin-based client. <br> - Provide an API
    (maybe a standard one) - that can be used to read the feed through other existing
    clients.<br><br>As for migration:<br> - Enable me to choose if I want my updated
    to continue to be channeled through twitter (for existing followers)<br> - After
    migration, when people follow me on Twitter automatically (using the twitter API)
    send them a @reply message with a link/information on how you can be followed
    without Twitter)

    languages going anywhere near what you are describing. In the last two years I
    invested in an intense learning curve of web-technologies (and I have a very strong
    background in software and technology) - and there is nothing simple about it.
    On the contrary, the amount of core skills required to create applications (which
    includes setup, configuration,administration... and programming) is growing and
    is in a contant state of flux.'

  content: I like what you&#39;re planning but <a href="http://Status.net" rel="nofollow">Status.net</a>
    software does much of what  <br>you describe and is open source. Identi.ca is
    a great example. There  <br>are others too, Tyler has started work and has a bare
    bones Ruby  <br>implementation of open social protocols. Our friend Brian created  <br>OpenMicroBlogger
    a php based open source social network (he may have  <br>leveraged P2, a wordpress
    blog template, I haven&#39;t looked at it  <br>recently). Twitter migration requires
    using the the API (they&#39;re not  <br>feed friendly yet besides rate limited
    rss).<br><br>I&#39;m focusing on the reading aspect now, and clearly organizing
    real  <br>time social streams with a Victus Media project. Of course I think if  <br>we
    use the same open standards all these various networks can  <br>communicate. Take
    a look at what&#39;s out there now and let me know where  <br>your design instincts
    take you.

  content: Hello Mark,<br><br>This reply may not be very coherent... I apologize for
    that as it may place a larger burden of understanding on you. Had I opted to write
    it out coherently I would probably have dropped it all-together... and I choose
    not too.So here goes nothing...<br><br>I have encountered some of the projects
    you described and I have very little interest in them because they are technologies
    and not products... I am not a developer ... I am not looking for capabilities...
    I am looking for good working products.<br><br>This, I believe, is one of the
    greatest shortcoming of open-source... so many great technologies,very few of
    them mature into relevant products... the missing discipline is, for lack of a
    better name, design.<br><br>I apologize to any developer who may take offense
    from this next generalization... if you&#39;re a good developer you can&#39;t
    be a good designer. The mindsets are in conflict and too broad to reside in the
    same mind. <br><br>RSS is a great example...a wonderous technology and unimportant
    under-rated product. I have a feeling that if tech-oriented users could step outside
    their bubble... that you would be amazed at how such a basic, important, simple,mature
    technology is a complete unknown to most of the people on the internet. <br><br>There
    isn&#39;t one decent, as in user-friendly, pleasant, easy to install, fun to use
    open source RSS solution out there... it takes a company like Google to formulate
    a product (reader) that utilizes that technology for their own means.<br><br>I
    am fairly technologically-proficient - I can install WordPress (after quite a
    learning curve), I can&#39;t install OS-stuff on my VPS linux hosting account.
    I have very little motivation to explore technologies...I am looking for good
    products.<br><br>I don&#39;t want another information center - I already have
    one -my WordPress installation. I am highly vested in it, I know it, I am comfortable
    with, I like it...<br><br>WordPress (as an operating system!!) opened a wonderful
    door for developers via Plugins. They are easy to install and enable developers
    to extend WordPress to do .... anything. It&#39;s a great wrapper for developers
    to bring technologies to end-users. It&#39;s an amazing marketing platfom - because
    it has a vibrant and open community.<br><br>I don&#39;t know of a better popular,
    open source,ecologically healthy environment then WordPress ...which is why I
    am using it, and probably why you are too... I therefore choose WordPress as an
    anchor for my online presence. I&#39;m not really interested or open to other
    options - I AM dying for more capabilities. <br><br>If you want to make an impact,
    provide a worthy alternative for Twitter (or the  likes) - that has to come in
    a bundled package I can bring into my life without giving it a second thought...
    in a clck of a button.<br><br>I believe this is why Apple is riding such a high
    wave these days. <br><br>I believe that open-source can be one of the most serious
    contenders to Apple and its likes...<br><br>But to do that open-source and its
    key players are going to have to mature... so that their work can mature... and
    make a difference... otherwise, pardon my bluntness, open-source is mostly jerking
    off ...great fun... not very effective<br><br>For me, the best technology from
    the list you provided will be the the one bundled as a good WordPress plugin!
    I care very little about their internals,capabilities and what nots ... that doesn&#39;t
    mean that you shouldn&#39;t care (or someone like you)... but you have to realize
    that I (and most of the people on the planet) don&#39;t care... and don&#39;t
    want to.<br><br>Did you know that amongst audiophiles the sound-quality of the
    iPod is considered poor-to-medium?... and yet it&#39;s one of the most popular
    & best selling music devices in the industry... other less known manufacturers
    provide great sounding devices with a compromised user-experience... but nobody
    knows about them.<br><br>Twitter&#39;s lock-in isn&#39;t weird at all.. that should
    be your point of departure if you want to truly challenge their offering.  <br><br>There...I
    have poured it all out :)<br><br>Thanks for the tolerance.<br>Ronen

  content: 'I&#39;d argue that Wordpress is an application platform not an operating
    system but I think I understand the way you use it. You do know that Wordpress
    is open source right? And it&#39;s pretty far from touching oneself ;)<br><br>On
    developers and designers: Those two skill sets do appear to be in conflict in
    different people but my favorite developers are wonderful designers and vice versa,
    of course my perspective is fairly limited. The best developers strive to understand
    how best to design, and the best designer need to be hands on to understand what
    is technologically feasible or flawed. <br><br>I see a wonderful trend of placing
    powerful design tools in the hands of domain experts that weren&#39;t able to
    do so with previous technologies. Perhaps one generation from now, everyone will
    be programming. The barrier to entry "wants" to be lower. The role of designers
    and users is blending, and neither have time to spend countless hours learning
    obscure technologies. Simple and effective tools will be the most popular, and
    wildly supported'

  content: 'Yes I do know that WordPress is open-source.<br><br>I think WordPress
    is a rare gem in the open-source community (and that&#39;s a shame - so much unrealized
    potential).<br><br>I look forward to discussing with you what design is... without
    that it would be difficult and pointless do pursue the developer/designer issue.
    I guess there may be examples of people who can do both ... I believe they are
    very rare... <br><br>Despite all my love for WordPress I do believe it (as a community
    of developers) is greatly fond of messing around with itself. Unless you are aware
    of it&#39;s internal workings( ie, a developer), it hasn&#39;t made any substantial
    progress as a product in quite a long time (except maybe the admin that, if memory
    serves, changed in 2.7). <br><br>The WordPress numbers are impressive but, in
    my opinion, nowhere near where they can and should be headed. For example, in
    my mind WordPress has failed, as a product, because it has nothing to offer for
    non-technical users - who end up using and enslaved to a commercial (non open-source)
    service like tumblr. <br><br>Here&#39;s how this may play out in the WordPress
    community: <br> - It&#39;s fairly easy to simplify WordPress, the community could
    maybe develop a plugin that would do this.<br> - But "the community" are all developers
    who for the life of them do not  understand why this is necessary, they love options
    and complexity - and they don&#39;t need this plugin.<br> - So I put together
    a description of this plugin (because I am designer, not a developer).<br> - I
    post that idea on WordPress Ideas... and it&#39;s get burried amongst a huge pile
    of small tweaks and features.<br> - and now I feel like I&#39;m playing with myself...
    so I forget about it<br> - case closed<br><br>... and if some day someone actually
    digs their teeth into this - they will realize it&#39;s not so simple. It requires
    brave commitment to simplicity - choosing for users (instead of leaving users
    to make their own choices) what features should be tossed out, and what the bare
    minimum should be - to make REALLY SIMPLE for non-technical users to publish stuff.<br><br>And
    how about a branch of WordPress for Education?<br>And how about a branch of WordPress
    for Kids & Families?<br><br>One key element in design (I believe) is to design
    for someone and some purpose. WordPress has never committed to such a paradigm.
    It is a "do anything you want" tool for publishing content... ummm..... blogging....
    ummm... CMS... ummmm... <br><br>And when you don&#39;t have a development process
    aimed at some purpose and some persona - it ends up gravitating to being something
    the developers like to use... which is what WordPress is ... and most of how it
    is evolving...<br><br>So it&#39;s a great project.... but it is not even close
    to realizing it&#39;s potential as a product. 10 milllion self-hosted blogs is
    nothing... there can/should be 100 million online presences - self hosted, open-source
    based ... free from enslavement to coporate entities... they should be coming
    out of Tumblr, Facebook, LinkedIn ... <br><br>but all of those are not WordPress
    installations - they are Products based on WordPress ... and that is something
    the developer community is not geared to deliver<br><br>... what disappoints me
    the most... is that there is no way to even have this conversation in the WordPress
    community... I may be crazy and straight our wrong ... but can we at least talk
    about it?<br><br>The new WordPress UI mailing list can go on for ages discussion
    if a font should be with or without italics, dark gray or darker gray...  that
    is NOT design... and is, in my opinion, much closer to self playign with yourself...<br><br>I
    seem to be venting a lot energy...I expect that to fade in a few days :)'

  content: Your internal struggle reminds me of my friend Shana. We most certainly
    have<br>different definitions of design, but there are some overlapping areas.<br>Accessibility
    is a major weakness of the wordpress platform, and why Tumblr<br>and Posterous

<p>If you're thinking about migrating your social stream off of a platform you've come to the right place. After 4-5 days mostly weened (I sent a few @replies) off of original content creation on Twitter here are my biggest findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's no lack of information available outside of Twitter. There are plenty of real time news sites, social sharing networks, and high quality blogs. The primary problem isn't that we need more content, but that we need help reducing noise. As more platforms adopt Pubsubhubbub and Salmon, both real time updates down and up through the network can occur without intermediaries</li>
<li>Reading more than a few dozen posts a day isn't reasonable unless you're getting paid to, certainly other work suffers. Even though I do the majority of my reading while out walking I have other ebooks I could be reading, or technical research. I freed up a ton of mindshare</li>
<li>It's the people I follow that suffer the most. I no longer reshare, comment on their statuses, or answer their questions on the platform. Likewise folks that enjoyed this interaction that follow me also miss out</li>
<li>I still scan over my Twitter follow stream and comment some on Buzz. I chose Buzz for now because it's a social sharing site that supports real time feeds, full data portability &amp; longer archiving</li>
<li>Isolated 140 character posts aren't enough to build real connections. On the web the defining identity the URL has unlimited length. In practice browsers can't handle more than a couple of thousands characters, but even this limit is much more capable. If 140 characters is a design decision for reading speed and SMS, simply truncate after 140 and have the best of both worlds. On the web, I'm free to use as much space as I need. The majority of poems, a great case of concise thoughts, can't fit in 140</li>
<li>140 characters + annotations is enough to self market or market partner offers</li>
</ul>
<p>Superficial attention grabbing appears to be what centralized social networks do best. They're not the distributed social information tool I think we both need and can construct with today's open web formats.</p>
<p>If you want an open sharing platform I don't believe Twitter, and certainly not Facebook are it. Neither are protocols supporting web friendly networks. These businesses create artificial bottlenecks that capture value based on subtle social network lock in. I suspect they'll become much more open and web friendly as external networks converge on communication protocols, and provide competition (see <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/xauth_is_this_everyone_else_against_facebook_conne.php">Marshall Kirkpatrick's XAuth article</a>).</p>
<p>Since I can get all the information I want outside of Twitter, what service is it really providing? It's a great implementation of the observer design pattern, and handles a large central data flow of text updates, but it doesn't provide value beyond casual introductions, and marketing channels. Nearly all of the people I follow on Twitter I met outside of their network, on blog comment sections, as commenters on this blog, or Friendfeed. I'll continue to interract with these folks with greater than 140. Moving my social information flow off of Twitter has been liberating in a way that's hard to put to words. If you want to see what I'm up to you can visit my <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/messel">Google profile</a> for now, or stop by here.</p>
<p>Update:<br />
Robert Scoble had <a href="http://www.google.com/buzz/louisgray/Qpm8pbqmePr/10-Suggestions-for-Redesigning-the-Google-Profile">suggested interest</a> in moving his favorites into Buzz. But I quickly found out, the favorites aren't his to move. The RSS is rate limited and can't easily be exported from twitter to other networks, in an open web format. This is a perfect example of the gilded cage of social networks, and proof of data ownership. </p>
