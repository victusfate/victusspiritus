  content: Thanks Arnold for your honest commentary. I do see a place for marketing,
    but that&#39;s best done by people that really enjoy one&#39;s work. <br><br>As
    far as research goes (and commenting), I&#39;m about as diehard of a supporter
    as you can find. <br><br>While navigating my way through writing, business, and
    life, I refer to the same question after each exchange. Did we both benefit from
    the interaction and if the answer is a resounding YES, I&#39;m going the right
    direction.

<p>Today's post was made possible thanks to an anonymous commenter that requested I stop spamming reddit. Over the past year I have submitted links to different subreddits that I found topically matched a specific post. Today I accept that this was a error in judgement.  </p>
<ul>
<li>First because very few users of crowd source sites actually <a href="http://victusfate.github.io/victusspiritus/uncategorized/2009/12/13/add-nation-90-of-social-media-referrals-dont-read/">read web pages</a>, and I write for only a small subset of the readers (in addition to myself)</li>
<li>Second because it's a distraction from writing. <strong>Commenting and discussing posts on Reddit is like trying to sell Quantum Mechanics texts at a strip club</strong> (<a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You%27re_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!">unless Richard Feynman was there</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll still share my posts on twitter or other subscription based architectures. Folks can opt in or out on those anytime.</p>
<h2>If marketing is a distraction, how do we find our authentic audience?</h2>
<p>Seth Godin discusses leadership and tribes with Loic Lemeur:<br />
<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Q6vpBDFoMqc&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&feature=player_embedded&fs=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Q6vpBDFoMqc&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&feature=player_embedded&fs=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<h2>Who are they?</h2>
<p>An authentic audience is all the people who share a genuine appreciation for the content you make possible, and the message you convey. Kevin Kelly calls them <a HREF="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/03/1000_true_fans.php">"true fans"</a>. Seth Godin loves the idea and is a huge fan of Kevin's.</p>
<p>So who are your true fans? </p>
<ul>
<li>They're the folks who visit your blog every day, and share it with all their friends. They also comment and add value to your site whenever they can</li>
<li>They're the people that buy their holiday gifts from a link on your site</li>
<li>They passionately let you know when you divert from the course you first set out on</li>
<li>They buy your art, use your web service, and help you make it better because they want to see you gloriously succeed</li>
<li>They help you build legendary products, works of art, or services</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why We're Hardwired to distrust self marketers</h2>
<p>The accepted social filter is, "if this guy or girl is really fantastic, why isn't someone else telling me about them". It's the classic chicken or the egg situation. </p>
<p>From when I first started writing up until this morning I was convinced new authors have to market themselves. But I have a new spin on the execution of marketing. Focus all your energies on creating something wonderful first. The best way to do this is to share your creation with only a tiny group of people. Start with one person who really loves what you do, then look for another. If you market yourself to only a single person at a time the interchange is much more personable.</p>
