    before mainstream adopts it.

  content: 'I agree, but will not ditch cable because of my love for sports. There
    just isn''t a solution out there (legally) that will allow me to watch my favorite
    home teams. I understand MLB has an online paid streaming service, but the NFL,
    NHL, and NBA aren''t quite there yet. Until this issue is resolved, there will
    be many with cable subscriptions for the sole purpose of watching sports. '

  content: Understood Tom. The sports fan just doesn't have a direct subscription
    method in place yet that covers their favorite teams. Would be a killer move for
    netflix or a competitor to offer a sports package but many live events are designed
    around commercial breaks.

  content: Our family quit cable TV in favour of Netflix and other internet sources
    in January.  I just can't sit and watch TV for any length of time be it sports,
    movies, or otherwise anyway - I just have too many other things I'd rather be
    doing with my limited free time.

  content: "I made the choice to cut off the television last summer with the only
    regret that they shut it off the week before the World Cup Finals. However, I
    was able to follow along from Internet feeds quite nicely.\n\nBetween the disaster
    / violence / etc. programming that is there for ratings purposes only, neither
    I nor my family miss it. We read books, talk to each other, and have a host of
    other hobbies / crafts to take up our time. \n\nLike the author, I manage to keep
    up on current events through the Internet (although many of the \"traditional\"
    news sites post the same sort of sensationalist nonsense that their cable and
    broadcast outlets \"provide\").\n"

    "If it bleeds, it leads."  Pure exploitation of Man's instinct to pay attention to conflict.  This book, literally changed my life: "Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television."  I haven't had cable for ten years or more, nor an actual TV for most of that time.

    And yeah, when I see TV in a waiting room, I usually try to find a way to unplug it, but so many other viewers must have their fix.  Another reason I always carry ear-plugs, or the TV-B-Gone.

    Most TV programming today, is pure poison.  Jerry Mander would argue, it is, will be, and always has been, that there's _no_ redeeming value.

    i stopped watching tv in 2002. when i was 20. i started again when i moved to the states in 2007. every second day or so i watched some tv, zapping trough the channels that comcast gave me. it lasted half a year till i had enough. im really not the hippie type or in any way alternative nor do i tell people to go outside instead of watching tv. i just can't stand whats going on in between the shows. i watch dexter, how i met your mother, mad men, two and a half men, fam guy, american dad, modern family, robot chicken etc. when a show i like is up, i'll go on tuesday on my fav. warez board, collect the rapidshare links together and start a couple wgets ;)
    dont get me wrong, i pay for all my software and i go to the movies with my friends a lot but i do not want to see tv advertising. btw. took me an hour to convince those cox guys here in cali that i want internet but no cable tv...

  content: "oh btw. the reason i can't stand tv: it makes me feel dumb on a really
    fundamental level. i can't even explain it. even more so with US tv. the news
    are just terrible. it gives me this icky, itchy feeling that the reporter just
    doesnt want to tell the truth and acts more like a dumb puppet. \nbut tv ads are
    even worse... a tv ad for meds, when they start talking really fast about the
    side effects to the end of the spot, while there is still the image of a happy
    world going on in the picture - this just doesnt make sense. and the worsta ads
    are for food. it literally makes me sick to my stomeg seeing pieces of meet getting
    swollowed by a river of gravy up close... or any other food. think about it, is
    there actually food in tv ads, up close, that is actually good?\n\ntv is fitted
    for dumb people. dont watch it, dont let your kids watch it, not even your dog.
    rather get a tivo and netflix and read more real news from independent sources."

<p>As I waited at Firestone for a new tire to replace the <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/2010/11/03/driver-safety-tip-a-slight-loss-of-vehicle-stability-is-a-good-sign-to-pull-over/">blowout</a> I had Tuesday, I was stuck listening to the morning news. In twenty minutes I heard about mass destruction from weather, a sick robbery, rape and multiple murder by fire, and the questionable death of a surfer found with methadone. Any being capable of the slightest bit of empathy is affected by such information. I was sickened at the negative focus of broadcast news. </p>
<p>Each and every morning hundreds of millions of Americans are watching and listening to these messages. Even if consciously we recognize that horrific reports represent only a tiny fraction of people, what type of subconscious image does this paint of the people in our society? What image does this impart globally to people who watch our broadcast stations? At the very least it portrays our culture as a sadistic, with a fetish for shocking news.</p>
<p>I stopped paying for cable television in 2006, following the lead of my friend Aakin who had dumped cable a few years earlier. There was very little worth watching, it wasn't available when I had time to watch it, and the programming I did enjoy* was plagued by commercials. The act of changing my content consumption from cable to internet video via Netflix and other commercial free web video, has been an absolute win decision on every level.</p>
<p>I'm not suggesting we turn a blind eye to negative events in our nation. But there's absolutely no need to make tragedies the driving focus of news. Good riddance cable and network television. I'm satisfied getting high quality programs piecemeal and commercial fee via Internet subscriptions services. I couldn't be happier getting my news by reading sharp bloggers and curators in areas I'm most concerned with (startups, tech, coding).</p>
<p>Notes:<br />
*= cable shows/channels I dig: comedy central, history channel, discovery channel, and scifi before it was syfy.</p>
