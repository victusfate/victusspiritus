  content: "The one thing that soothes my soul is watching the flow and sound of waves
    finding their way onto shore.  Not that my family shares this value with me, hence
    I consider it quality time to be occasionally go by the beach on my own.   It
    irks me no end when I have my family around and they seem to be living for the
    clock especially when I want them to just let me be.\n\nSo I hope you enjoy this
    time out alone and though I know you have high regard for your other half; enjoy
    these moments of solitude (and yep take heed of the person who said put ocean
    before phone).  I have had moments when I have watched the waves and they have
    strangely coincided with great transitional moments in my life.  \n\nSo I never
    underestimate the moment and talking of the beach, let your mind be still and
    your spirit open, and your body will thank you later.  Enjoy the time away, time
    will still be here waiting for you, when you get back.\n\n[Em]"

    it's good.

<h2>Summer Staycation is a welcome change</h2>
<p>Today marks day three of a few weeks off from work. My wife and I couldn't synch our time off yet this summer, so we pushed off our plans for a proper vacation later in the year. I needed time away from systems and simulations engineering and a slow down at work opened up the ideal opportunity for extended time away from the office. I'm grateful for the chance to recharge my enthusiasm for both my day job and self assigned side projects. My purely interest driven work has been in limbo since earlier this year except for a few client side <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/tag/coffeescript/">CoffeeScript hacks</a>.</p>
<p>The air quality is exceptional after the muggy heat wave we had late last week. As I walk besides the ocean, the water has taken on a nearly tropical cyan hue. I can feel my internal clock unwinding as I enjoy an unstructured schedule and give my full attention to the moment. These are the days I dream of, care free and distant from immediate task driven concerns and distractions.</p>
<p>Speaking of distractions, another beach goer just reminded me:</p>
<blockquote><p>
"Don't miss the beach cause you're on the phone"
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now it's time I follow their advice.</p>
