  content: I have a comment but it&#39;s in a slightly different direction...<br><br>This
    isn&#39;t to criticize the likes of Seth Godin or other motivational, or enlightened,
    leaders.  But I think a lot of people read that stuff, get a real good feeling
    after they read it, and are unable to make any real changes.  For myself this
    has meant getting jazzed about an approach or outlook, implementing it for a day
    or two, and then having it fall apart.  This eventually turned into a form of
    avoidance -- seeking the high from thinking I&#39;ve understood someone else&#39;s
    insight; to guilt -- the low from dropping the ball.<br><br>Why does it fall apart?  My
    thought is that it wasn&#39;t internalized.  When I&#39;ve had real insights that
    have stuck, things that help me move forward in my life it is usually apparent
    that no words I could string together would have helped me explain it to my past
    self.  And really, I doubt explaining a set of circumstances or actions to create
    that insight would work, either.  <br><br>In short, I&#39;ve sloughed off most
    &#39;enlightened leaders,&#39; except for the occasional times when I&#39;m working
    on something personal and know the person might have some tidbits. <br><br>Curious
    what you think about this?

  content: I think I understand what you&#39;re describing. Learning, but beyond the
    ability to communicate that learning. And with that knowledge you come to believe
    that the thing you learned is something that no one else could teach you with
    words, you had to understand it for yourself.<br><br>I consider the best learning
    from successful folks to be leading by example. Sure, they&#39;ll try and wrestle
    out some language that captures the essential priorities that helped them get
    where they are in life. As long as that&#39;s a place worth emulating, then I
    think there&#39;s a point in them trying.<br><br>No one can necessarily make us
    better, or achieve our goals. We have to look within to find that path, that drive
    and motivation. But there are plenty of opportunities to become lost on our way,
    and a few helpful words and a pat on the back can go a long way at the right moment.

<p>Allow me to kick this riff off with recognizing how lucky some of us are. I'm not talking about hot hands at dice, wild poker streaks or betting against a cooler (sorry Jimbo). This is about the good fortune of being able to recognize the benefits of doing work that's personally meaningful. To have realized that it's possible to do work that we love for a living is a critical first step. But to find and actively do such labor puts us in a tiny fraction of people worldwide. I couldn't find specifics stats but odds are the vast majority of workers would rather be doing something else. A friendly reminder, the work you love may not be your day job or primary income, at least not yet.</p>
<p>There are a handful of varied views about doing work that we most enjoy: </p>
<ul>
<li>There's a group that isn't doing what they care about for a living. This group doesn't believe it's possible to find work that they love, or that work by definition has to be something we loathe or tolerate in order to yield maximum financial reward. Let's call this group the <i>non-believers</I>*</li>
<li>The second group isn't doing what they love for a living, but they see others who love what they do and believe it's possible. But for this group, they can't imagine shifting their primary work to something they care deeply for. I'll label this group <i>skeptics</I></li>
<li>The third group isn't doing what they love for a living yet, but are on their way to doing so with self motivated projects. They believe the greatest path to generating real wealth is spending most of their time doing meaningful work they enjoy. Let's call this group the <i>journeymen</I>^</li>
<li>The last group is doing what they love and actively working to enable other folks to do the same. While they suffer job stress and over work themselves, the alignment of labor and personal meaning is super fuel that makes them unstoppable. Let's call this group <i>enlightened leaders</I></li>
</ul>
<h2>What do Enlightened Leaders strive for?</h2>
<p>If you have found or crafted your dream job, and are doing work that matters, where do you go next? I assume enlightened leaders actively try to help others realize the powerful life path that they are living proof of. But they're not shouting loud enough for all of us to hear, or they realize we have to figure it out for ourselves. It's gotta be frustrating for people like <a HREF="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth</a>, <a HREF="http://kk.org">Kevin</a>, <a href="http://www.avc.com">Fred</a>, <a href="http://scobleizer.com">Robert</a>, <a href="http://blog.louisgray.com/">Louis</a> and any of the other <a href="http://www.victusspiritus.com/my-friends-and-influencers/">folks I have had the pleasure of connecting with</a> to keep on calling out their deeply satisfying work and not having anyone pick up. Thousands or millions of us tune in, but many miss the encoded signal¥. They should all know their message is coming through loud and clear, but it takes us normal folks a little time to follow their lead ;).   </p>
<p>Notes:<br />
*= heh, gotta love the spiritual spin from the agnostic<br />
^= I fall into the journeymen category<br />
¥=  The "do work that matters" mantra is not so encoded for Seth, he cuts to the chase in his writings, evident in his latest work Lynchpin. </p>
